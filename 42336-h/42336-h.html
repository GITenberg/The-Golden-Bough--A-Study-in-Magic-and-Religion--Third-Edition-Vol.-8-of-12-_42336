          their character as such is still further brought out by their
          association, or even identification, with Silvanus and the
          Silvanuses, who, as their name of itself indicates, are spirits of
          the woods.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=

          "#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> proves
          that the Satyrs also were woodland deities. These goat-formed
          spirits of the woods have their counterparts in the folk-lore of
          Northern Europe. Thus, the Russian wood-spirits, called <span lang=
          "ru" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ru"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ljeschie</span></span> (from <span lang="ru"

          "font-style: italic">ljes</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“wood”</span>) are believed to appear partly in human
          shape, but with the horns, ears, and legs of goats. The <span lang=
          "ru" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ru"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ljeschi</span></span> can alter his stature at
          pleasure; when he walks in the wood he is as tall as the trees;
          when he walks in the meadows he is no higher than the grass. Some
          of the <span lang="ru" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "ru"><span style="font-style: italic">Ljeschie</span></span> are
          spirits of the corn as well as of the wood; before harvest they are
          as tall as the corn-stalks, but after it they shrink to the height
          of the stubble.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=

          brings out—what we have remarked before—the close connexion between
          tree-spirits and corn-spirits, and shews how easily the former may
          melt into the latter. Similarly the Fauns, though wood-spirits,
          were believed to foster the growth of the crops.<a id="noteref_14"

          "Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Pans, Satyrs,
          and Fauns perhaps belong to a widely diffused class of wood-spirits
          conceived in goat-form. The fondness of goats for straying in woods
          and nibbling the bark of trees, to which indeed they are most
          destructive, is an obvious and perhaps sufficient reason why
          wood-spirits should so often be supposed to take the form of goats.
          The inconsistency of a god of vegetation subsisting upon the
          vegetation which he personifies is not one to strike the primitive
          mind. Such inconsistencies arise when the deity, ceasing to be
          immanent in the vegetation, comes to be regarded as its owner or
          lord; for the idea of owning the vegetation naturally leads to that
          of subsisting on it. We have already seen that the corn-spirit,
          originally conceived as immanent in the corn, afterwards comes to
          be regarded as its owner, who lives on it and is reduced to poverty
          and want by being deprived of it.<a id="noteref_17" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
          representation of wood-spirits in the form of goats appears to be
          both widespread and, to the primitive mind, natural. Therefore when
          we find, as we have done, that Dionysus—a tree-god—is sometimes
          represented in goat-form,<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href=
          "#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> we can
          hardly avoid concluding that this representation is simply a part
          of his proper character as a tree-god and is not to be explained by
          the fusion of two distinct and independent worships, in one of
          which he originally appeared as a tree-god and in the other as a
          goat. If such a fusion took place in the case of Dionysus, it must
          equally have taken place in the case of the Pans and Satyrs of
          Greece, the Fauns of Italy, and the <span lang="ru" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ru"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ljeschie</span></span> of Russia. That such a
          fusion of two wholly disconnected worships should have occurred
          once is possible; that it should have occurred twice independently
          is improbable; that it should have occurred thrice independently is
          so unlikely as to be practically incredible.</p>

          shape of a bull. After what has gone before we are naturally led to

          the close association of Dionysus with Demeter and Persephone in
          the mysteries of Eleusis shews that he had at least strong
          agricultural affinities. The other possible explanation of the
          bull-shaped Dionysus would be that the conception of him as a bull
          was originally entirely distinct from the conception of him as a
          deity of vegetation, and that the fusion of the two conceptions was
          due to some such circumstance as the union of two tribes, one of
          which had previously worshipped a bull-god and the other a
          tree-god. This appears to be the view taken by Mr. Andrew Lang, who
          suggests that the bull-formed Dionysus <span class="tei tei-q">“had
          either been developed out of, or had succeeded to, the worship of a
          bull-totem.”</span><a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href=
          "#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> Of
          course this is possible. But it is not yet certain that the Aryans
          ever had totemism.<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href=
          "#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> On the
          other hand, it is quite certain that many Aryan peoples have
          conceived deities of vegetation as embodied in animal forms.
          Therefore when we find amongst an Aryan people like the Greeks a
          deity of vegetation represented as an animal, the presumption must
          be in favour of explaining this by a principle which is certainly
          known to have influenced the Aryan race rather than by one which is
          not certainly known to have done so. In the present state of our
          knowledge, therefore, it is safer to regard the bull form of
          Dionysus as being, like his goat form, an expression of his proper
          character as a deity of vegetation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The probability
          of this view will be somewhat increased if it can be shewn that in
          other rites than those of Dionysus the ancients slew an ox as a
          representative of the spirit of vegetation. This they appear to
          have done in the Athenian sacrifice known as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the murder of the ox”</span> (<span lang="el" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bouphonia</span></span>). It took place about
          the end of June or beginning of July, that is, about the time when
          the threshing is nearly over in Attica. According to tradition the
          sacrifice was instituted to procure a cessation of drought and
          dearth which had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg
          005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          afflicted the land. The ritual was as follows. Barley mixed with
          wheat, or cakes made of them, were laid upon the bronze altar of
          Zeus Polieus on the Acropolis. Oxen were driven round the altar,
          and the ox which went up to the altar and ate the offering on it
          was sacrificed. The axe and knife with which the beast was slain
          had been previously wetted with water brought by maidens called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“water-carriers.”</span> The weapons were
          then sharpened and handed to the butchers, one of whom felled the
          ox with the axe and another cut its throat with the knife. As soon
          as he had felled the ox, the former threw the axe from him and
          fled; and the man who cut the beast's throat apparently imitated
          his example. Meantime the ox was skinned and all present partook of
          its flesh. Then the hide was stuffed with straw and sewed up; next
          the stuffed animal was set on its feet and yoked to a plough as if
          it were ploughing. A trial then took place in an ancient law-court
          presided over by the King (as he was called) to determine who had
          murdered the ox. The maidens who had brought the water accused the
          men who had sharpened the axe and knife; the men who had sharpened
          the axe and knife blamed the men who had handed these implements to
          the butchers; the men who had handed the implements to the butchers
          blamed the butchers; and the butchers laid the blame on the axe and
          knife, which were accordingly found guilty, condemned and cast into
          the sea.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href=

          mode of selecting the victim suggests that the ox which tasted the
          corn was viewed as the corn-deity taking possession of his own.
          This interpretation is supported by the following custom. In
          Beauce, in the district of Orleans, on the twenty-fourth or
          twenty-fifth of April they make a straw-man called <span class=

          "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">mondard</span></span> is now
          dead and it is necessary to make a new one. The straw-man is
          carried in solemn procession up and down the village and at last is
          placed upon the oldest apple-tree. There he remains till the apples
          are gathered, when he is taken down and thrown into the water, or

          who, dead in winter, revives when the apple-blossoms appear on the
          boughs. Thus the person who plucks the first fruit from the tree
          and thereby receives the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“the great
          <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mondard</span></span>”</span> must be regarded
          as a representative of the tree-spirit. Primitive peoples are
          usually reluctant to taste the annual first-fruits of any crop,
          until some ceremony has been performed which makes it safe and
          pious for them to do so. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg
          007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          The reason of this reluctance appears to be a belief that the
          first-fruits either belong to or actually contain a divinity.
          Therefore when a man or animal is seen boldly to appropriate the
          sacred first-fruits, he or it is naturally regarded as the divinity
          himself in human or animal form taking possession of his own. The
          time of the Athenian sacrifice, which fell about the close of the
          threshing, suggests that the wheat and barley laid upon the altar
          were a harvest offering; and the sacramental character of the
          subsequent repast—all partaking of the flesh of the divine
          animal—would make it parallel to the harvest-suppers of modern
          Europe, in which, as we have seen, the flesh of the animal who
          stands for the corn-spirit is eaten by the harvesters. Again, the
          tradition that the sacrifice was instituted in order to put an end
          to drought and famine is in favour of taking it as a harvest
          festival. The resurrection of the corn-spirit, enacted by setting
          up the stuffed ox and yoking it to the plough, may be compared with
          the resurrection of the tree-spirit in the person of his
          representative, the Wild Man.<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27"

          clearly, perhaps, does the identification of the corn-spirit with
          an ox come out in the sacrificial ritual which the Greeks of
          Magnesia on the Maeander observed in honour of Zeus Sosipolis, a
          god whose title of Sosipolis (<span class="tei tei-q">“Saviour of
          the City”</span>) marks him as the equivalent of Zeus Polieus
          (<span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus of the City”</span>). The details of
          the ritual are happily preserved in an inscription, which records a
          decree of the council and of the people for the regulation of the
          whole proceedings. Every year at a festival in the month of Heraeon
          the magistrates bought the finest bull that could be had for money,
          and at the new moon of the month of Cronion, at the time when the
          sowing was about to begin, they and the priests dedicated the
          animal to Zeus Sosipolis, while solemn prayers were offered by the
          voice of a sacred herald for the welfare of the city, of the land,
          and of the people, for peace and wealth, for the corn-crops and all
          other fruits, and for the cattle. Thereafter the sacred animal was
          kept throughout the winter, its keep being undertaken by a
          contractor, who was bound by law to drive the bull to the market
          and there collect contributions for its <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> maintenance from all the hucksters and in
          particular from the corn-chandlers; and a prospect was held out to
          such as contributed that it would go well with them. Finally, after
          having been thus maintained at the public cost for some months, the
          bull was led forth with great pomp and sacrificed in the
          market-place on the twelfth day of the month Artemision, which is
          believed to have been equivalent to the Attic month of Thargelion
          and to the English month of May, the season when the corn is reaped
          in the Greek lowlands. In the procession which attended the animal
          to the place of sacrifice the senators, the priests, the
          magistrates, the young people, and the victors in the games all
          bore a part, and at the head of the procession were borne the
          images of the Twelve Gods attired in festal array, while a
          fluteplayer, a piper, and a harper discoursed solemn music.<a id=

          the bull, which was thus dedicated at the time of sowing and kept
          at the cost of the pious, and especially of corn-chandlers, to be
          finally sacrificed at harvest, it is reasonable to see an
          embodiment of the corn-spirit. Regarded as such the animal was
          consecrated when the seed was committed to the earth; it was fed
          and kept all the time the corn was growing in order that by its
          beneficent energies it might foster that growth; and at last, to
          complete the parallel, when the corn was reaped the animal was
          slain, the cutting of the stalks being regarded as the death of the
          corn-spirit.<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=

          Similarly we have seen that in the harvest-fields and on the
          threshing-floors of modern Europe the corn-spirit is often
          conceived in the form of a bull, an ox, or a calf, which is
          supposed to be killed at reaping or threshing; and, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> further, we saw that the conception is
          sometimes carried out in practice by slaughtering a real ox or a
          real calf on the harvest-field. Thus the parallelism between the
          ancient Greek and the modern European idea of the corn-spirit
          embodied in the form of a bull appears to be very close.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the
          interpretation which I have adopted of the sacrifices offered to
          Zeus Polieus and Zeus Sosipolis the corn-spirit is conceived as a
          male, not as a female, as Zeus, not as Demeter or Persephone. In
          this there is no inconsistency. At the stage of thought which the
          Greeks had reached long before the dawn of history they supposed
          the processes of reproduction in nature to be carried on by a male
          and a female principle in conjunction; they did not believe, like
          some backward savages, that the female principle alone suffices for
          that purpose, and that the aid of the male principle is
          superfluous. Hence, as we have seen, they imagined that the
          goddesses of the corn, the mother Demeter and the daughter
          Persephone, had each her male partner with whom she united for the
          production of the crops. The partner of Demeter was Zeus, the
          partner of Persephone was his brother Pluto, the Subterranean Zeus,
          as he was called; and reasons have been shewn for thinking that the
          marriage of one or other of these divine pairs was solemnised at
          Eleusis as part of the Great Mysteries in order to promote the
          growth of the corn.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ox appears
          as a representative of the corn-spirit in other parts of the world.
          At Great Bassam, in Guinea, two oxen are slain annually to procure
          a good harvest. If the sacrifice is to be effectual, it is
          necessary that the oxen should weep. So all the women of the
          village sit in front of the beasts, chanting, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The ox will weep; yes, he will weep!”</span> From time
          to time one of the women walks round the beasts, throwing manioc
          meal or palm wine upon them, especially into their eyes. When tears
          roll down from the eyes of the oxen, the people dance, singing,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The ox weeps! the ox weeps!”</span> Then
          two men seize the tails of the beasts and cut them off at one blow.
          It is believed that a great misfortune will happen in the course of
          the year if the tails are not severed at one blow. The oxen are
          afterwards <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg

          probably a rain-charm. We have already seen that the virtue of the
          corn-spirit, embodied in animal form, is sometimes supposed to
          reside in the tail, and that the last handful of corn is sometimes
          conceived as the tail of the corn spirit.<a id="noteref_33" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> In the
          Mithraic religion this conception is graphically set forth in some
          of the numerous sculptures which represent Mithras kneeling on the
          back of a bull and plunging a knife into its flank; for on certain
          of these monuments the tail of the bull ends in three stalks of
          corn, and in one of them corn-stalks instead of blood are seen
          issuing from the wound inflicted by the knife.<a id="noteref_34"

          representations certainly suggest that the bull, whose sacrifice
          appears to have formed a leading feature in the Mithraic ritual,
          was conceived, in one at least of its aspects, as an incarnation of
          the corn-spirit.</p>

          clearly does the ox appear as a personification of the corn-spirit
          in a ceremony which is observed in all the provinces and districts
          of China to welcome the approach of spring. On the first day of
          spring, usually on the third or fourth of February, which is also
          the beginning of the Chinese New Year, the governor or prefect of
          the city goes in procession to the east gate of the city, and
          sacrifices to the Divine Husbandman, who is represented with a
          bull's head on the body of a man. A large effigy of an ox, cow, or
          buffalo has been prepared for the occasion, and stands outside of
          the east gate, with agricultural implements beside it. The figure
          is made of differently-coloured pieces of paper pasted on a
          framework either by a blind man or according to the directions of a
          necromancer. The colours of the paper prognosticate the character
          of the coming year; if red prevails, there will be many fires; if
          white, there will be floods and rain; and so with the other
          colours. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg
          011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          mandarins walk slowly round the ox, beating it severely at each
          step with rods of various hues. It is filled with five kinds of
          grain, which pour forth when the effigy is broken by the blows of
          the rods. The paper fragments are then set on fire, and a scramble
          takes place for the burning fragments, because the people believe
          that whoever gets one of them is sure to be fortunate throughout
          the year. A live buffalo is next killed, and its flesh is divided
          among the mandarins. According to one account, the effigy of the ox
          is made of clay, and, after being beaten by the governor, is stoned
          by the people till they break it in pieces, <span class=

          the ceremony varies somewhat in the different provinces. According
          to another account the effigy of the cow, made of earthenware, with
          gilded horns, is borne in procession, and is of such colossal
          dimensions that forty or fifty men can hardly carry it. Behind this
          monstrous cow walks a boy with one foot shod and the other bare,
          personifying the Genius of Industry. He beats the effigy with a
          rod, as if to drive it forward. A great many little clay cows are
          afterwards taken out of the large one and distributed among the
          people. Both the big cow and the little ones are then broken in
          pieces, and the people take the sherds home with them in order to
          grind them to powder and strew the powder on their fields, for they
          think thus to secure a plentiful harvest.<a id="noteref_36" name=

          cities nearest to Weihaiwei, in northern China, the ceremony of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Beginning of Spring”</span> is a
          moveable feast, which falls usually in the first moon. The local
          magistrate and his attendants go in procession to the eastern
          suburbs of the city to <span class="tei tei-q">“meet the
          Spring.”</span> A great pasteboard effigy of an ox is carried in
          the procession, together with another pasteboard image of a man
          called Mang-Shen, <span class="tei tei-q">“who represents either
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name=
          "Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> typical ox-driver or
          ploughman or the god of Agriculture.”</span> On the return of the
          procession to the magistrate's court, that dignitary himself and
          his principal colleagues beat and prod the pasteboard ox with
          wands, after which the effigy is burned along with the image of its
          attendant. The colours and apparel of the two effigies correspond
          with the forecasts of the Chinese almanack. Thus if the head of the
          ox is yellow, the summer will be very hot; if it is green, the
          spring will be sickly; if it is red, there will be a drought; if it
          is black, there will be much rain; if it is white, there will be
          high winds. If Mang-Shen wears a hat, the year will be dry; if he
          is bareheaded, it will be rainy; and so on with the other articles
          of his apparel. Besides the pasteboard ox a miniature ox made of
          clay is also supposed to be provided.<a id="noteref_37" name=

          "tei tei-q">“beating the spring,”</span> which seems to prove that
          the ox is identified with the vernal energies of nature. We may
          suppose that originally the ox which figures in the rite was a
          living animal, but ever since the beginning of our era, when the
          custom first appears in history, it has been an effigy of
          terra-cotta or pasteboard. To this day the Chinese calendar devotes
          a page to a picture of <span class="tei tei-q">“the ox of
          spring”</span> with Mang, the tutelary genius of spring, standing
          beside it and grasping a willow-bough, with which he is about to
          beat the animal for the purpose of stimulating its reproductive
          virtue.<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href=

          form of this Chinese custom the corn-spirit appears to be plainly
          represented by the corn-filled ox, whose fragments may therefore be
          supposed to bring fertility with them. We may compare the Silesian
          custom of burning the effigy of Death, scrambling for the burning
          fragments, and burying them in the fields to secure a good crop,
          and the Florentine custom of sawing the Old Woman and scrambling
          for the dried fruits with which she was filled.<a id="noteref_39"

          in Annam, every year at the approach of spring the Department of
          Rites publishes instructions to the provincial governors as to the
          manner in which the festival of the inauguration of spring is to be
          celebrated. Among the indispensable features of the festival are
          the figures of an ox and its warder made of terra-cotta. The
          attitudes of the two and the colours to be applied to them are
          carefully prescribed every year in the Chinese calendar. Popular
          opinion attributes to the colour of the ox and the accoutrement of
          its warder, who is called Mang Than, a certain influence on the
          crops of the year: a green, yellow, and black buffalo
          prognosticates an abundant harvest: a red or white buffalo
          foretells wretched crops and great droughts or hurricanes. If Mang
          Than is represented wearing a large hat, the year will be rainy; if
          on the other hand <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg
          014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          he is bareheaded, long barren droughts are to be feared. Nay, the
          public credulity goes so far as to draw good or evil omens from the
          cheerfulness or ill humour which may be detected on the features of
          the Warder of the Ox. Having been duly prepared in accordance with
          the directions of the almanack, the ox and its warder are carried
          in procession, followed by the mandarins and the people, to the
          altar of Spring, which is usually to be found in every provincial
          capital. There the provincial governor offers fruits, flowers, and
          incense to the Genius of Spring (<span lang="zh" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="zh"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Xuan Quan</span></span>), and gold and silver
          paper money are burnt on the altar in profusion. Lastly the ox and
          his warder are buried in a spot which has been indicated by a
          geomancer.<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> It is
          interesting to observe that the three colours of the ox which are
          taken to prognosticate good crops, to wit, green, yellow, and
          black, are precisely the colours which the ancients attributed to
          Demeter, the goddess of the corn.<a id="noteref_42" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great
          importance which the Chinese attach to the performance of rites for
          the fertility of the ground is proved by an ancient custom which
          is, or was till lately, observed every year in spring. On an
          appointed day the emperor himself, attended by the highest
          dignitaries of the state, guides with his own hand the ox-drawn
          plough down several furrows and scatters the seed in a sacred
          field, or <span class="tei tei-q">“field of God,”</span> as it is
          called, the produce of which is afterwards examined from time to
          time with anxious care by the Governor of Peking, who draws omens
          from the appearance of the ears; it is a very happy omen if he
          should chance to find thirteen ears growing on one stalk. To
          prepare himself for the celebration of this solemn rite the emperor
          is expected to fast and remain continent for three days previously,
          and the princes and mandarins who accompany him to the field are
          bound to observe similar restrictions. The corn grown on the holy
          field which has thus been ploughed by the imperial hands is
          collected in yellow sacks and stored in a special granary to be
          used by the emperor in certain solemn sacrifices which he offers to
          the god <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg

          corn-spirit to console him for the depredations they committed on
          all the rest of his domains. Again, the rule of fasting and
          continence observed by the Emperor of China and his august

          perhaps shed light on the custom of rending a live bull or goat at
          the rites of Dionysus. The animal was torn in fragments, as the
          Khond victim was cut in pieces, in order that the worshippers might
          each secure a portion of the life-giving and fertilising influence
          of the god. The flesh was eaten raw as a sacrament, and we may
          conjecture that some of it was taken home to be buried in the
          fields, or otherwise employed so as to convey to the fruits of the
          earth the quickening influence of the god of vegetation. The

          the pig was regularly sacrificed in her mysteries, the reason
          assigned being that the pig injures the corn and is therefore an
          enemy of the goddess.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href=

          after an animal has been conceived as a god, or a god as an animal,
          it sometimes happens, as we have seen, that the god sloughs off his
          animal form and becomes purely anthropomorphic; and that then the
          animal, which at first had been slain in the character of the god,
          comes to be viewed as a victim offered <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to the god on the ground of its hostility to
          the deity; in short, the god is sacrificed to himself on the ground
          that he is his own enemy. This happened to Dionysus,<a id=
          "noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> and it
          may have happened to Demeter also. And in fact the rites of one of
          her festivals, the Thesmophoria, bear out the view that originally
          the pig was an embodiment of the corn-goddess herself, either
          Demeter or her daughter and double Persephone. The Attic
          Thesmophoria was an autumn festival, celebrated by women alone in
          October,<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href=
          "#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          appears to have represented with mourning rites the descent of

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> we
          learn some details about the mode of celebrating the Thesmophoria,
          which shed important light on the part of the festival called the
          Descent or the Ascent. The scholiast tells us that it was customary
          at the Thesmophoria to throw pigs, cakes of dough, and branches of
          pine-trees into <span class="tei tei-q">“the chasms of Demeter and
          Persephone,”</span> which appear to have been sacred caverns or
          vaults.<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href=
          "#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> In
          these caverns or vaults <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg
          018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          there were said to be serpents, which guarded the caverns and
          consumed most of the flesh of the pigs and dough-cakes which were
          thrown in. Afterwards—apparently at the next annual festival<a id=
          "noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>—the
          decayed remains of the pigs, the cakes, and the pine-branches were
          fetched by women called <span class="tei tei-q">“drawers,”</span>
          who, after observing rules of ceremonial purity for three days,
          descended into the caverns, and, frightening away the serpents by
          clapping their hands, brought up the remains and placed them on the
          altar. Whoever got a piece of the decayed flesh and cakes, and
          sowed it with the seed-corn in his field, was believed to be sure
          of a good crop. With the feeding of the serpents in the vaults by
          the women we may compare an ancient Italian ritual. At Lanuvium a
          serpent lived in a sacred cave within a grove of Juno. On certain
          appointed days a number of holy maidens, with their eyes bandaged,
          entered the grove carrying cakes of barley in their hands. Led, as
          it was believed, by the divine spirit, they walked straight to the
          serpent's den and offered him the cakes. If they were chaste, the
          serpent ate the cakes, the parents of the girls rejoiced, and
          farmers prognosticated an abundant harvest. But if the girls were
          unchaste, the serpent left the cakes untasted, and ants came and
          crumbled the rejected viands and so removed them bit by bit from
          the sacred grove, thereby purifying the hallowed spot from the
          stain it had contracted by the presence of a defiled maiden.<a id=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the following legend was told. At the
          moment when Pluto carried off Persephone, a swineherd called
          Eubuleus chanced to be herding his swine on the spot, and his herd
          was engulfed in the chasm down which Pluto vanished with
          Persephone. Accordingly at the Thesmophoria pigs were annually
          thrown into caverns to commemorate the disappearance of the swine
          of Eubuleus.<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href=
          "#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> It
          follows from this that the casting of the pigs into the vaults at
          the Thesmophoria formed part of the dramatic representation of
          Persephone's descent into the lower world; and as no image of
          Persephone appears to have been thrown in, we may infer that the
          descent of the pigs was not so much an accompaniment of her descent
          as the descent itself, in short, that the pigs were Persephone.
          Afterwards when Persephone or Demeter (for the two are equivalent)
          took on human form, a reason had to be found for the custom of
          throwing pigs into caverns at her festival; and this was done by
          saying that when Pluto carried off Persephone, there happened to be
          some swine browsing near, which were swallowed up along with her.
          The story is obviously a forced and awkward attempt to bridge over
          the gulf between the old conception of the corn-spirit as a pig and
          the new conception of her as an anthropomorphic goddess. A trace of
          the older conception survived in the legend that when the sad
          mother was searching for traces of the vanished Persephone, the
          footprints of the lost one were obliterated by the footprints of a
          pig;<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href=
          "#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a>
          originally, we may conjecture, the footprints of the pig were the
          footprints of Persephone and of Demeter herself. A consciousness of
          the intimate connexion of the pig with the corn lurks in the legend
          that the swineherd Eubuleus was a brother of Triptolemus, to whom
          Demeter first imparted the secret of the corn. Indeed, according to
          one version of the story, Eubuleus himself received, jointly with
          his brother Triptolemus, the gift of the corn from Demeter as a
          reward for revealing to her the fate of Persephone.<a id=

          till the following year, when it was taken up to be sown with the
          seed-corn in the fields for the purpose of securing a good crop; so
          in the neighbourhood of Grenoble the goat killed on the

          to put it generally, the corn-spirit is killed in animal form in
          autumn; part of his flesh is eaten as a sacrament by his

          the corn-spirit is conceived as alive throughout the year; he lives
          and works under ground, but is brought up each autumn to be renewed
          and then replaced in his subterranean abode.<a id="noteref_70"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If persons of
          fastidious taste should object that the Greeks never could have
          conceived Demeter and Persephone to be embodied in the form of
          pigs, it may be answered that in the cave of Phigalia in Arcadia
          the Black Demeter was portrayed with the head and mane of a horse
          on the body of a woman.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href=

          Between the portrait of a goddess as a pig, and the portrait of her
          as a woman with a horse's head, there is little to choose in
          respect of barbarism. The legend told of the Phigalian Demeter
          indicates that the horse was one of the animal forms assumed in
          ancient Greece, as in modern Europe,<a id="noteref_72" name=

          corn-spirit. It was said that in her search for her daughter,
          Demeter assumed the form of a mare to escape the addresses of
          Poseidon, and that, offended at his importunity, she withdrew in
          dudgeon to a cave not far from Phigalia in the highlands of Western
          Arcadia. The very cavern, now turned into a little Christian chapel
          with its holy pictures, is still shewn to the curious traveller far
          down the side of that profound ravine through which the brawling
          Neda winds under overhanging woods to the sea. There, robed in
          black, she tarried so long that the fruits of the earth were
          perishing, and mankind would have died of famine if Pan had not
          soothed the angry goddess and persuaded her to quit the cave. In
          memory of this event, the Phigalians set up an image of the Black
          Demeter in the cave; it represented a woman dressed in a long robe,
          with the head and mane of a horse.<a id="noteref_73" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Passing now to
          Attis and Adonis, we may note a few facts which seem to shew that
          these deities of vegetation had also, like other deities of the

          abstained from eating the flesh of swine.<a id="noteref_74" name=

          appears to indicate that the pig was regarded as an embodiment of

          in the same direction. For after the examples of the goat Dionysus
          and the pig Demeter it may almost be laid down as a rule that an
          animal which is said to have injured a god was originally the god
          himself. Perhaps the cry of <span class="tei tei-q">“Hyes Attes!

          variations in the legend serve to shew that, while the connexion of
          the boar with Adonis was certain, the reason of the connexion was
          not understood, and that consequently different stories were
          devised to explain it. Certainly the pig ranked as a sacred animal
          among the Syrians. At the great religious metropolis of Hierapolis
          on the Euphrates pigs were neither sacrificed nor eaten, and if a
          man touched a pig he was unclean for the rest of the day. Some
          people said this was because the pigs were unclean; others said it
          was because the pigs were sacred.<a id="noteref_81" name=
          "noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> This
          difference of opinion points to a hazy state of religious thought
          in which the ideas of sanctity and uncleanness are not yet sharply
          distinguished, both being blent in a sort of vaporous solution to
          which we give the name of taboo. It is quite consistent with this
          that the pig should have been held to be an embodiment of the
          divine Adonis, and the analogies of Dionysus and Demeter make it
          probable that the story of the hostility of the animal to the god
          was only a late misapprehension of the old view of the god as
          embodied in a pig. The rule that pigs were not sacrificed or eaten
          by worshippers of Attis and presumably of Adonis, does not exclude
          the possibility that in these rituals the pig was slain on solemn
          occasions as a representative of the god and consumed sacramentally
          by the worshippers. Indeed, the sacramental killing and eating of
          an animal implies that the animal is sacred, and that, as a general
          rule, it is spared.<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The attitude of
          the Jews to the pig was as ambiguous as that of the heathen Syrians
          towards the same animal. The Greeks could not decide whether the
          Jews worshipped swine or abominated them.<a id="noteref_83" name=

          one hand they might not eat swine; but on the other hand they might
          not kill them. And if the former rule speaks for the uncleanness,
          the latter <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg
          024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          speaks still more strongly for the sanctity of the animal. For
          whereas both rules may, and one rule must, be explained on the
          supposition that the pig was sacred; neither rule must, and one
          rule cannot, be explained on the supposition that the pig was
          unclean. If, therefore, we prefer the former supposition, we must
          conclude that, originally at least, the pig was revered rather than
          abhorred by the Israelites. We are confirmed in this opinion by
          observing that down to the time of Isaiah some of the Jews used to
          meet secretly in gardens to eat the flesh of swine and mice as a
          religious rite.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href=

          Doubtless this was a very ancient ceremony, dating from a time when
          both the pig and the mouse were venerated as divine, and when their
          flesh was partaken of sacramentally on rare and solemn occasions as
          the body and blood of gods. And in general it may be said that all
          so-called unclean animals were originally sacred; the reason for
          not eating them was that they were divine.</p>

          temple, and they were the only men who were thus excluded. No one
          would give his daughter in marriage to a swineherd, or marry a
          swineherd's daughter; the swineherds married among
          themselves.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href=

          Egyptians sacrificed pigs to the moon and to Osiris, and not only
          sacrificed them, but ate of their flesh, though on any other day of
          the year they would neither sacrifice them nor taste of their
          flesh. Those who were too poor to offer a pig on this day baked
          cakes of dough, and offered them instead.<a id="noteref_89" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The view that in
          Egypt the pig was sacred is borne out by the very facts which, to
          moderns, might seem to prove the contrary. Thus the Egyptians
          thought, as we have seen, that to drink pig's milk produced
          leprosy. But exactly analogous views are held by savages about the
          animals and plants which they deem most sacred. Thus in the island
          of Wetar (between New Guinea and Celebes) people believe themselves
          to be variously descended from wild pigs, serpents, crocodiles,
          turtles, dogs, and eels; a man may not eat an animal of the kind

          The Syrians, in antiquity, who esteemed fish sacred, thought that

          to bathe the body in a decoction made from the bone of the animal,

          they say at once that its father has been eating his totem and that

          Similarly among the Waheia, another tribe of the same region, if a

          that the eating of the totem produces a severe cutaneous eruption,

          examples prove that the eating of a sacred animal is often believed
          to produce leprosy or other skin-diseases; so far, therefore, they
          support the view that the pig must have been sacred in Egypt, since
          the effect of drinking its milk was believed to be leprosy. Such
          fancies may perhaps have been sometimes suggested by the
          observation that the eating of semi-putrid flesh, to which some
          savages are addicted, is apt to be followed by eruptions on the
          skin. Indeed, many modern authorities attribute leprosy to this
          cause, particularly to the eating of half rotten fish.<a id=

          seems not impossible that the abhorrence which the Hebrews
          entertained of leprosy, and the pains which they took to seclude
          lepers from the community, may have been based on religious as well
          as on purely sanitary grounds; they may have imagined that the
          disfigurement of the sufferers was a penalty which they had
          incurred by some infraction of taboo. Certainly we read in the Old
          Testament of cases of leprosy which the historian regarded as the
          direct consequence of sin.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102"

          personally belonging to him, had to perform a certain ceremony
          before he could feed himself with his hands; otherwise it was

          of opinion that the Egyptians spared the pig, not out of
          abhorrence, but from a regard to its utility in agriculture; for,

          contradictory feelings, he may be said to occupy a position of
          unstable equilibrium. In course of time one of the contradictory
          feelings is likely to prevail over the other, and according as the
          feeling which finally predominates is that of reverence or
          abhorrence, the being who is the object of it will rise into a god
          or sink into a devil. The latter, on the whole, was the fate of the
          pig in Egypt. For in historical times the fear and horror of the
          pig seem certainly to have outweighed the reverence and worship of
          which he may once have been the object, and of which, even in his
          fallen state, he never quite lost trace. He came to be looked on as
          an embodiment of Set or Typhon, the Egyptian devil and enemy of
          Osiris. For it was in the shape of a black pig that Typhon injured
          the eye of the god Horus, who burned him and instituted the
          sacrifice of the pig, the sun-god Ra having declared the beast
          abominable.<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href=
          "#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a>
          Again, the story that Typhon was hunting a boar when he discovered
          and mangled the body of Osiris, and that this was the reason why
          pigs were sacrificed once a year,<a id="noteref_119" name=
          "noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a> is
          clearly a modernised version of an older story that Osiris, like
          Adonis and Attis, was slain <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> or mangled by a boar, or by Typhon in the
          form of a boar. Thus, the annual sacrifice of a pig to Osiris might
          naturally be interpreted as vengeance inflicted on the hostile
          animal that had slain or mangled the god. But, in the first place,
          when an animal is thus killed as a solemn sacrifice once and once
          only in the year, it generally or always means that the animal is
          divine, that he is spared and respected the rest of the year as a
          god and slain, when he is slain, also in the character of a
          god.<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href=
          "#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> In
          the second place, the examples of Dionysus and Demeter, if not of
          Attis and Adonis, have taught us that the animal which is
          sacrificed to a god on the ground that he is the god's enemy may
          have been, and probably was, originally the god himself. Therefore,
          the annual sacrifice of a pig to Osiris, coupled with the alleged
          hostility of the animal to the god, tends to shew, first, that
          originally the pig was a god, and, second, that he was Osiris. At a
          later age, when Osiris became anthropomorphic and his original
          relation to the pig had been forgotten, the animal was first
          distinguished from him, and afterwards opposed as an enemy to him
          by mythologists who could think of no reason for killing a beast in
          connexion with the worship of a god except that the beast was the
          god's enemy; or, as Plutarch puts it, not that which is dear to the
          gods, but that which is the contrary, is fit to be
          sacrificed.<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href=
          "#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a> At
          this later stage the havoc which a wild boar notoriously makes
          amongst the corn would supply a plausible reason for regarding him
          as the foe of the corn-spirit, though originally, if I am right,
          the very freedom with which the boar ranged at will through the
          corn led people to identify him with the corn-spirit, to whom he
          was afterwards opposed as an enemy.</p>

          will uproot a whole field, and destroy the husbandman's hopes for
          the year. The places they love to frequent are the reedy marshes
          and thickets by rivers and lakes, and they swarm in the thickets
          all along the banks of the Jordan from Jericho to the Lake of
          Gennesaret. From these fastnesses, whence neither dog nor man can
          dislodge them, they make nightly forays upon the corn-fields and
          root-crops of the villagers, returning at daybreak to their
          coverts. About Jericho they are especially destructive, and when
          the barley crop is ripening, the husbandmen have to keep nightly
          watch to drive them away. Their presence can always be detected by

          Persephone into the lower world; and both customs are parallel to

          the similar relation of red-haired men and red oxen to Typhon. For
          in regard to the red-haired men who were burned and whose ashes
          were scattered with winnowing-fans, we have seen fair grounds for
          believing that originally, like the red-haired puppies killed at
          Rome in spring, they were representatives of the corn-spirit

          ground of their resemblance to the corn-spirit Osiris. We have seen

          to put them on a different footing from the ordinary sacred animals

          this were so, ancient Egypt would exhibit a stratification of three
          great types of religion or superstition corresponding to three

          as a species of superstitious respect paid to wild animals and
          plants by many tribes in the hunting stage of society, would be
          represented by the worship of the local sacred animals; the worship
          of cattle, which belongs to society in the pastoral stage, would be
          represented by the cults of Apis and Mnevis; and the worship of
          cultivated plants, which is peculiar to society in the agricultural
          stage, would be represented by the religion of Osiris and Isis. The
          Egyptian reverence for cows, which were never killed,<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> might
          belong either to the second or the third of these stages. The
          consecration of cows to Isis, who was portrayed with cow's
          horns<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href=
          "#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          may have been supposed to be incarnate in the animals, would
          indicate that they, like the red oxen, were embodiments of the
          corn-spirit. However, this identification of Isis with the cow,
          like that of Osiris with the bulls Apis and Mnevis, may be only an
          effect of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg

          syncretism. But whatever the original relation of Apis to Osiris
          may have been, there is one fact about the former which ought not
          to be passed over in a disquisition on the custom of killing a god.
          Although the bull Apis was worshipped as a god with much pomp and
          profound reverence, he was not suffered to live beyond a certain
          length of time which was prescribed by the sacred books, and on the
          expiry of which he was drowned in a holy spring.<a id="noteref_139"

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To prevent
          misunderstandings it may be well to add that what I have just said
          as to the stratification of three great types of religion or
          superstition corresponding to three great types of society is not
          meant to sketch, even in outline, the evolution of religion as a
          whole. I by no means wish to suggest that the reverence for wild
          animals and plants, the reverence for domestic cattle, and the
          reverence for cultivated plants are the only forms of religion or
          superstition which prevail at the corresponding stages of social
          development; all that I desire to convey is that they are
          characteristic of these stages respectively. The elements which
          make up any religious system are far too numerous and their
          interaction far too complex to be adequately summed up in a few
          simple formulas. To mention only a single factor of which I have
          taken no account in indicating roughly a certain correspondence
          between the strata of religion and of society, the fear of the
          spirits of the dead appears to have been one of the most powerful
          factors, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg
          037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          perhaps, indeed, the most powerful of all, in shaping the course of
          religious evolution at every stage of social development from the
          lowest to the highest; and for that very reason it is not specially
          characteristic of any one form of society. And the three types of
          religion or superstition which I have selected as characteristic of
          three stages of society are far from being strictly limited each to
          its corresponding step in the social ladder. For example, although
          totemism, or a particular species of reverence paid by groups of
          men to wild animals and plants, probably always originated in the
          hunting stage of society, it has by no means been confined to that
          primitive phase of human development but has often survived not
          only into the pastoral but into the agricultural stage, as we may
          see for example by the case of many tribes in Africa, India, and
          America; and it seems likely that a similar overlapping of the
          various strata takes place in every instance. In short, we cannot
          really dissect the history of mankind as it were with a knife into
          a series of neat sections each sharply marked off from all the rest
          by a texture and colour of its own; we may indeed do so
          theoretically for the convenience of exposition, but practically
          the textures interlace, the colours melt and run into each other by
          insensible gradations that defy the edge of the finest instrument
          of analysis which we can apply to them. It is a mere truism to say
          that the abstract generalisations of science can never adequately
          comprehend all the particulars of concrete reality. The facts of
          nature will always burst the narrow bonds of human theories.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before quitting
          this part of our subject it may be well to illustrate by one or two
          examples the reverence which primitive pastoral tribes pay to their
          cattle, since, as I have just indicated, the worship of sacred
          bulls by the ancient Egyptians, like the modern Hindoo worship of
          cows, may very well have been directly derived from a similar
          respect paid by their remote ancestors to their cattle. A good
          instance is supplied by the Dinka, a large cattle-breeding tribe,
          or rather nation, of the White Nile. <span class="tei tei-q">“Every
          idea and thought of the Dinka,”</span> says Schweinfurth,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“is how to acquire and maintain cattle: a
          kind of reverence would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg
          038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          seem to be paid to them; even their offal is considered of high
          importance; the dung, which is burnt to ashes for sleeping in and
          for smearing their persons, and the urine, which is used for
          washing and as a substitute for salt, are their daily requisites.
          It must be owned that it is hard to reconcile this latter usage
          with our ideas of cleanliness. A cow is never slaughtered, but when
          sick it is segregated from the rest, and carefully tended in the
          large huts built for the purpose. Only those that die naturally or
          by an accident are used as food. All this, which exists among most
          of the pastoral tribes of Africa, may perchance appear to be a
          lingering remnant of an exploded cattle-worship; but I may draw
          attention to the fact that the Dinka are by no means disinclined to
          partake of any feast of their flesh, provided that the slaughtered
          animal was not their own property. It is thus more the delight of
          actual possession, than any superstitious estimate, that makes the
          cow to them an object of reverence. Indescribable is the grief when
          either death or rapine has robbed a Dinka of his cattle. He is
          prepared to redeem their loss by the heaviest sacrifices, for they
          are dearer to him than wife or child. A dead cow is not, however,
          wantonly buried; the negro is not sentimental enough for that; such
          an occurrence is soon bruited abroad, and the neighbours institute
          a carousal, which is quite an epoch in their monotonous life. The
          bereaved owner himself is, however, too much afflicted at the loss
          to be able to touch a morsel of the carcass of his departed beast.
          Not unfrequently in their sorrow the Dinka remain for days silent
          and abstracted, as though their trouble were too heavy for them to
          bear.”</span><a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href=

          fat ox. It is of a white colour passing into a slaty grey on the
          shoulders and legs: its long horns are artificially bent to
          opposite sides and adorned with bunches of hair: the tuft of the

          respect may be grounded on the simple fact that cattle are the only
          possession of these negroes. The largest and handsomest bull is the
          leader of the herd; he is decked with bunches of hair and small

          his contentment by a complacent lowing. To him his master every
          morning commits the herd, in order that he may guide them to the
          best pastures and guard them from danger; in him he reveres his

              embodiment of Virbius and was annually sacrificed in the grove.
              Similarly at Athens the goat was usually excluded from the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are now in a
          position to hazard a conjecture as to the meaning of the tradition

          Having found, first, that spirits of the corn are not infrequently

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> and,
          second, that the animal which in later legends is said to have
          injured the god was sometimes originally the god himself, we may
          conjecture that the horses by which Virbius or Hippolytus was said
          to have been slain were really embodiments of him as a deity of
          vegetation. The myth that he had been killed by horses was probably
          invented to explain certain features in his worship, amongst others
          the custom of excluding horses from his sacred grove. For myth
          changes while custom remains constant; men continue to do what
          their fathers did before them, though the reasons on which their
          fathers acted have been long forgotten. The history of religion is
          a long attempt to reconcile old custom with new reason, to find a
          sound theory for an absurd practice. In the case before us we may
          be sure that the myth is more modern than the custom and by no
          means represents the original reason for excluding horses from the
          grove. From their exclusion it might be inferred that horses could
          not be the sacred animals or embodiments of the god of the grove.
          But the inference would be rash. The goat was at one time a sacred
          animal or embodiment of Athena, as may be inferred from the
          practice of representing the goddess clad in a goat-skin
          (<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">aegis</span></span>). Yet the goat was
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name=
          "Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> neither sacrificed
          to her as a rule, nor allowed to enter her great sanctuary, the
          Acropolis at Athens. The reason alleged for this was that the goat
          injured the olive, the sacred tree of Athena.<a id="noteref_147"
          name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> So
          far, therefore, the relation of the goat of Athena is parallel to
          the relation of the horse to Virbius, both animals being excluded
          from the sanctuary on the ground of injury done by them to the god.
          But from Varro we learn that there was an exception to the rule
          which excluded the goat from the Acropolis. Once a year, he says,
          the goat was driven on to the Acropolis for a necessary
          sacrifice.<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href=
          "#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> Now,
          as has been remarked before, when an animal is sacrificed once and
          once only in the year, it is probably slain, not as a victim
          offered to the god, but as a representative of the god himself.
          Therefore we may infer that if a goat was sacrificed on the
          Acropolis once a year, it was sacrificed in the character of Athena
          herself;<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> and
          it may be conjectured that the skin of the sacrificed animal was
          placed on the statue of the goddess and formed the <span lang="el"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">aegis</span></span>, which would thus be
          renewed annually. Similarly at Thebes in Egypt rams were sacred and
          were not sacrificed. But on one day in the year a ram was killed,
          and its skin was placed on the statue of the god Ammon.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a> Now,
          if we knew the ritual of the Arician grove better, we might find
          that the rule of excluding horses from it, like the rule of
          excluding goats from the Acropolis at Athens, was subject to an
          annual exception, a horse being once a year taken into the grove
          and sacrificed as an embodiment of the god Virbius.<a id=

          the usual misunderstanding the horse <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          as an enemy offered up in sacrifice to the god whom he had injured,
          like the pig which was sacrificed to Demeter and Osiris or the goat
          which was sacrificed to Dionysus, and possibly to Athena. It is so
          easy for a writer to record a rule without noticing an exception
          that we need not wonder at finding the rule of the Arician grove
          recorded without any mention of an exception such as I suppose. If
          we had had only the statements of Athenaeus and Pliny, we should
          have known only the rule which forbade the sacrifice of goats to
          Athena and excluded them from the Acropolis, without being aware of
          the important exception which the fortunate preservation of Varro's
          work has revealed to us.</p>

          a year at Rome. On the fifteenth of October in each year a
          chariot-race was run on the Field of Mars. Stabbed with a spear,
          the right-hand horse of the victorious team was then sacrificed to
          Mars for the purpose of ensuring good crops, and its head was cut
          off and adorned with a string of loaves. Thereupon the inhabitants
          of two wards—the Sacred Way and the Subura—contended with each
          other who should get the head. If the people of the Sacred Way got
          it, they fastened it to a wall of the king's house; if the people
          of the Subura got it, they fastened it to the Mamilian tower. The
          horse's tail was cut off and carried to the king's house with such
          speed that the blood dripped on the hearth of the house.<a id=

          Further, it appears that the blood of the horse was caught and

          mixed it with the blood of the unborn calves which had been

          a string of loaves, and the alleged object of the sacrifice,
          namely, to procure a good harvest, seem to indicate that the horse
          was killed as one of those animal representatives of the
          corn-spirit of which we have found so many examples. The custom of
          cutting off the horse's tail is like the African custom of cutting

          crop.<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href=

          Again, the practice of fumigating the cattle in spring with the
          blood of the horse may be compared with the practice of giving the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman
          sacrifice of the October horse, as it was called, carries us back
          to the early days when the Subura, afterwards a low and squalid
          quarter of the great metropolis, was still a separate village,
          whose inhabitants engaged in a friendly contest on the
          harvest-field with their neighbours of Rome, then a little rural
          town. The Field of Mars on which the ceremony took place lay beside
          the Tiber, and formed part of the king's domain down to the
          abolition of the monarchy. For tradition ran that at the time when
          the last of the kings was driven from Rome, the corn stood ripe for
          the sickle on the crown lands beside the river; but no one would
          eat the accursed grain and it was flung into the river in such
          heaps that, the water being low with the summer heat, it formed the
          nucleus of an island.<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href=
          "#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          "Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The horse sacrifice
          was thus an old autumn custom observed upon the king's corn-fields
          at the end of the harvest. The tail and blood of the horse, as the
          chief parts of the corn-spirit's representative, were taken to the
          king's house and kept there; just as in Germany the harvest-cock is
          nailed on the gable or over the door of the farmhouse; and as the
          last sheaf, in the form of the Maiden, is carried home and kept
          over the fireplace in the Highlands of Scotland. Thus the blessing
          of the corn-spirit was brought to the king's house and hearth and,
          through them, to the community of which he was the head. Similarly
          in the spring and autumn customs of Northern Europe the Maypole is
          sometimes set up in front of the house of the mayor or burgomaster,
          and the last sheaf at harvest is brought to him as the head of the
          village. But while the tail and blood fell to the king, the
          neighbouring village of the Subura, which no doubt once had a
          similar ceremony of its own, was gratified by being allowed to
          compete for the prize of the horse's head. The Mamilian tower, to
          which the Suburans nailed the horse's head when they succeeded in
          carrying it off, appears to have been a peel-tower or keep of the
          old Mamilian family, the magnates of the village.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> The
          ceremony thus performed on the king's fields and at his house on
          behalf of the whole town and of the neighbouring village
          presupposes a time when each township performed a similar ceremony
          on its own fields. In the rural districts of Latium the villages
          may have continued to observe the custom, each on its own land,
          long after the Roman hamlets had merged their separate
          harvest-homes in the common celebration on the king's lands. There
          is no intrinsic improbability in the supposition that the sacred
          grove of Aricia, like the Field of Mars at Rome, may have been the
          scene of a common harvest celebration, at which a horse was
          sacrificed with the same rude rites on behalf of the neighbouring
          villages. The horse would represent the fructifying spirit both of
          the tree and of the corn, for the two ideas melt into each other,
          as we see in customs like the Harvest-May.</p>

          excluding horses from the sacred Arician grove may have been based
          on some other superstitious motive which entirely escapes us. At
          the city of Ialysus in Rhodes there was a sanctuary of Alectrona,
          one of the daughters of the Sun, into which no horse, ass, mule, or
          beast of burden of any kind might enter. Any person who broke the
          law by introducing one of these animals into the holy precinct, had
          to purify the place by a sacrifice; and the same atonement had to
          be made by any man who brought shoes or any portion of a pig within
          the sacred boundaries. And whoever drove or suffered his sheep to
          stray into the precinct was obliged to pay a fine of one obol for
          every sheep that set foot in it.<a id="noteref_160" name=

          reasons for these prohibitions are quite unknown; and the taboo on
          horses is particularly remarkable, since the Rhodians were in the
          habit of offering a chariot and horses every year to the Sun, the
          father of Alectrona,<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href=

          doubtless in order that he might ride on them through the sky. Did
          they think that it was not for the daughter of the Sun to meddle
          with horses, which were the peculiar property of her father? The
          conjecture may perhaps be supported by an analogy drawn from West
          Africa. The Ewe negroes of the Slave Coast conceive the Rain-god
          Nyikplã as a man who rides a horse, and who may be seen galloping
          on it through the sky in the form of a shooting star. Hence in the
          town of Angla, where he generally resides when he is at home, no
          person may appear on horseback in the streets, that being
          apparently regarded as an impious usurpation of the style of the
          deity. In former days even Europeans were forbidden to ride on
          horseback in Angla; and missionaries who attempted to set the local
          prejudice at defiance have been pelted with sticks and dirt by the
          outraged natives.<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href=

          was a village situated on the top of a hill about seven miles east
          of Tananarivo. But horses were not the only animal or thing to

          certain objects, which are carefully specified by the keepers of

          based on accidental circumstances which for us are lost past
          recovery. But it may be worth while to observe that a variety of
          taboos was enforced at other ancient Greek shrines besides the
          sanctuary of Alectrona at Ialysus. For example, no person was
          allowed to enter the sanctuary of the Mistress at Lycosura in
          Arcadia clad in black, purple, or flowered vestments, or wearing
          shoes or a ring, or with his or her hair plaited or covered, or

          in animal form, and that in both cases he is killed in the person
          of his representative and eaten sacramentally. To find examples of
          actually killing the human representative of the corn-spirit we had
          naturally to go to savage races; but the harvest-suppers of our
          European peasants have furnished unmistakable examples of the
          sacramental eating of animals as representatives of the
          corn-spirit. But further, as might have been anticipated, the new
          corn is itself eaten sacramentally, that is, as the body of the
          corn-spirit. In Wermland, Sweden, the farmer's wife uses the grain
          of the last sheaf to bake a loaf in the shape of a little girl;
          this loaf is divided amongst the whole household and eaten by
          them.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href=

          the loaf represents the corn-spirit conceived as a maiden; just as
          in Scotland the corn-spirit is similarly conceived and represented
          by the last sheaf made up in the form of a woman and bearing the
          name of the Maiden. As usual, the corn-spirit is believed to reside
          in the last sheaf; and to eat a loaf made from the last sheaf is,
          therefore, to eat the corn-spirit itself. Similarly at La Palisse,
          in France, a man made of dough is hung upon the fir-tree which is
          carried on the last harvest-waggon. The tree and the dough-man are
          taken to the mayor's house and kept there till the vintage is over.

          In other cases, though the new corn is not baked in loaves of human
          shape, still the solemn ceremonies with which it is eaten suffice
          to indicate that it is partaken of sacramentally, that is, as the
          body of the corn-spirit. For example, the following ceremonies used
          to be observed by Lithuanian peasants at eating the new corn. About
          the time of the autumn sowing, when all the corn had been got in
          and the threshing had begun, each farmer held a festival called
          Sabarios, that is, <span class="tei tei-q">“the mixing or throwing
          together.”</span> He took nine good handfuls of each kind of
          crop—wheat, barley, oats, flax, beans, lentils, and the rest; and
          each handful he divided into three parts. The twenty-seven portions
          of each grain were then thrown on a heap and all mixed up together.
          The grain used had to be that which was first threshed and winnowed
          and which had been set aside and kept for this purpose. A part of
          the grain thus mixed was employed to bake little loaves, one for
          each of the household; the rest was mixed with more barley or oats
          and made into beer. The first beer brewed from this mixture was for
          the drinking of the farmer, his wife, and children; the second brew
          was for the servants. The beer being ready, the farmer chose an
          evening when no stranger was expected. Then he knelt down before
          the barrel of beer, drew a jugful of the liquor and poured it on
          the bung of the barrel, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“O fruitful
          earth, make rye and barley and all kinds of corn to
          flourish.”</span> Next he took the jug to the parlour, where his
          wife and children awaited him. On the floor of the parlour lay
          bound a black or white or speckled (not a red) cock and a hen of
          the same colour and of the same brood, which must have been hatched
          within the year. Then the farmer knelt down, with the jug in his
          hand, and thanked God for the harvest and prayed for a good crop
          next year. Next all lifted up their hands and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O God, and thou, O earth, we give you this cock and
          hen as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg
          050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a
          free-will offering.”</span> With that the farmer killed the fowls
          with the blows of a wooden spoon, for he might not cut their heads
          off. After the first prayer and after killing each of the birds he
          poured out a third of the beer. Then his wife boiled the fowls in a
          new pot which had never been used before. After that, a bushel was
          set, bottom upwards, on the floor, and on it were placed the little
          loaves mentioned above and the boiled fowls. Next the new beer was
          fetched, together with a ladle and three mugs, none of which was
          used except on this occasion. When the farmer had ladled the beer
          into the mugs, the family knelt down round the bushel. The father
          then uttered a prayer and drank off the three mugs of beer. The
          rest followed his example. Then the loaves and the flesh of the
          fowls were eaten, after which the beer went round again, till every
          one had emptied each of the three mugs nine times. None of the food
          should remain over; but if anything did happen to be left, it was
          consumed next morning with the same ceremonies. The bones were
          given to the dog to eat; if he did not eat them all up, the remains
          were buried under the dung in the cattle-stall. This ceremony was
          observed at the beginning of December. On the day on which it took
          place no bad word might be spoken.<a id="noteref_168" name=

          and must hide in the forest. But the men of other tribes are
          invited to share in the festivity. On the day of the ceremony seven
          or eight yams are dug up with the greatest precaution, wrapt in
          leaves, and carried before the great wooden images, ten or twelve
          feet high, rudely carved in human form and painted black, red, and
          white, which represent the ancestors of the tribe. Special pots,
          only used on these occasions, are then disinterred by boys, who
          cook the new yams in them, eat them, and afterwards bury the pots
          in the places where they found them. Thereupon the chief or the
          oldest man mounts a ladder and addresses the crowd in a long and
          voluble harangue, telling them how their forefathers always
          respected the feast of the first yams, and exhorting the young men
          of the tribe to do the same in the time to come. After that,
          turning towards the ancestral images, he prays them to give a good

          Amongst the Coorgs of Southern India the man who is to cut the
          first sheaf of rice at harvest is chosen by an astrologer. At
          sunset the whole household takes a hot bath and then goes to the
          rice-field, where the chosen reaper cuts an armful of rice with a
          new sickle, and distributes two or more stalks to all present. Then
          all return to the threshing-floor. A bundle of leaves is adorned
          with a stalk of rice and fastened to the post in the centre of the
          threshing-floor. Enough of the new rice is now threshed, cleaned,
          and ground to provide flour for the dough-cakes which each member
          of the household is to eat. Then they go to the door of the house,
          where the mistress washes the feet of the sheaf-cutter, and
          presents to him, and after him to all the rest, a brass vessel full
          of milk, honey, and sugar, from which each person takes a draught.
          Next the man who cut the sheaf kneads a cake of rice-meal,
          plantains, milk, honey, seven new rice corns, seven pieces
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name=

          on. Every one receives a little of his cake on an Ashvatha leaf,
          and eats it. The ceremony is then over and the sheaf-cutter mixes
          with the company. When he was engaged in cutting the rice no one
          might touch him.<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href=

          the Hindoos of Southern India the eating of the new rice is the
          occasion of a family festival called Pongol. The new rice is boiled
          in a new pot on a fire which is kindled at noon on the day when,
          according to Hindoo astrologers, the sun enters the tropic of
          Capricorn. The boiling of the pot is watched with great anxiety by
          the whole family, for as the milk boils, so will the coming year
          be. If the milk boils rapidly, the year will be prosperous; but it
          will be the reverse if the milk boils slowly. Some of the new
          boiled rice is offered to the image of Gaṇeṣa; then every one
          partakes of it.<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188" href=

          as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "tei tei-q">“new grain.”</span> When the crop is ripe, the owner
          takes the omens, goes to the field, plucks five or six ears of
          barley in the spring crop and one of the millets in the autumn
          harvest. This is brought home, parched, and mixed with coarse
          sugar, butter, and curds. Some of it is thrown on the fire in the
          name of the village gods and deceased ancestors; the rest is eaten
          by the family.<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href=

          Gilgit, in the Hindoo Koosh, before wheat-harvest begins, a member
          of every household gathers a handful of ears of corn secretly at
          dusk. A few of the ears are hung up over the door of the house, and
          the rest are roasted next morning, and eaten steeped in milk. The
          day is spent in rejoicings, and next morning the harvest

          secret tillage,”</span> which are both sown and reaped with
          peculiar ceremonies. Apparently the tilling of the earth is
          considered a crime which must be perpetrated secretly and
          afterwards atoned for. On a lucky day in June, at the first
          cock-crow, two men lead the buffaloes and the plough to the sacred
          field, round which they draw three furrows in profound silence and
          then retire. Afterwards at dawn the owner of the land comes
          lounging by, as if by the merest chance. At sight of the furrows he
          stops, pretends to be much surprised, and cries out, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Who has been secretly ploughing my field this
          night?”</span> Hastening home, he kills a kid or some fowls, cooks
          the victuals, and prepares five quids of betel, some candles, a
          flask of oil, and lustral water of three different sorts. With
          these offerings and the plough drawn by the buffaloes, he returns
          to the field, where he lights the candles and spreading out the
          victuals worships Po-Nagar and the other deities, saying:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I know not who has secretly ploughed my
          field this night. Pardon, ye gods, those who have done this wrong.
          Accept these offerings. Bless us. Suffer us to proceed with this
          work.”</span> Then, speaking in the name of the deities, he gives
          the reassuring answer, <span class="tei tei-q">“All right. Plough
          away!”</span> With the lustral water he washes or sprinkles the
          buffaloes, the yoke, and the plough. The oil serves to anoint the
          plough and to pour libations on the ground. The five quids of betel
          are buried in the field. Thereupon the owner sows a handful of rice
          on the three furrows that have been traced, and eats the victuals
          with his people. After all these rites have been duly performed, he
          may plough and sow his land as he likes. When the rice has grown
          high enough in this <span class="tei tei-q">“field of secret
          tillage”</span> to hide pigeons, offerings of ducks, eggs, and
          fowls are made to the deities; and fresh offerings, which generally
          consist of five plates of rice, two boiled fowls, a bottle of
          spirits, and five quids of betel, are made to Po-Nagar and the rest
          at the time when the rice is in bloom. Finally, when the rice in
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the field of secret tillage”</span> is
          ripe, it has to be reaped before any of the rest. Offerings of
          food, such as boiled fowls, plates of rice, cakes, and so forth,
          are spread out on the field; a candle is lit, and a priest or, in
          his absence, the owner prays to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> guardian deities to come and partake of the
          food set before them. After that the owner of the land cuts three
          stalks of rice with a sickle in the middle of the field, then he
          cuts three handfuls at the side, and places the whole in a napkin.
          These are the first-fruits offered to Po-Nagar, the goddess of
          agriculture. On being taken home the rice from the three handfuls
          is husked, pounded in a mortar, and presented to the goddess with
          these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Taste, O goddess, these
          first-fruits which have just been reaped.”</span> This rice is
          afterwards eaten, while the straw and husks are burned. Having
          eaten the first-fruits of the rice, the owner takes the three
          stalks cut in the middle of the field, passes them through the
          smoke of the precious eagle-wood, and hangs them up in his house,
          where they remain till the next sowing-time comes round. The grain
          from these three stalks will form the seed of the three furrows in
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the field of secret tillage.”</span> Not
          till these ceremonies have been performed is the proprietor at
          liberty to reap the rest of that field and all the others.<a id=

          negroes of West Africa the eating of the new yams is the greatest
          festival of the year; it usually falls at the beginning of
          September, and its character is predominantly religious. We possess
          a native account of the festival <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> as it is celebrated by the tribe of the Hos
          in Togoland. When the yams are ripe and ready to be dug up and
          brought home, two days are devoted to cleansing the town of all
          ills, whether spiritual or material, as a solemn preparation for
          the ensuing celebration. When these rites of purification, which
          will be described in a later part of this work, have been
          accomplished, then, in the words of the native account,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the people make ready to eat the new yams.
          And the manner of making ready consists in going to the fields and
          digging the yams. However, they do not bring them home but lay them
          down somewhere on the way. The reason why they do not bring them
          home is that the people have not yet been on the place where they
          sacrifice to the deity. When they wish to go thither, the way to
          the sacrificial place of Agbasia must first be cleared of grass.
          Afterwards the people come with their drums, which they beat
          loudly. When they are come to the place of sacrifice, they first
          raise two great mounds of earth, and they bring to the place of
          sacrifice palm wine, uncooked and cooked yams, and meal mixed with
          oil. First of all the uncooked yams are cut in two through the
          middle, and then this prayer is offered: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Agbasia, thou art he who has given the yams; therefore
          here is thine own! We thank thee sincerely. May the eating of the
          yams be a great joy, and may no quarrel intervene!’</span>
          Thereupon they lay down on the ground yams mixed with oil and not
          mixed with oil. In doing so they say to Agbasia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘He who eats not the white yams, to him belong the yams
          mixed with oil; and he who eats not the yams mixed with oil, to him
          belong the white yams.’</span> They do the same with the meal that
          is mixed with oil and with the meal that is not mixed with oil.
          Thereby they say: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Here we bring thee all
          that thou hast given us. Eat thereof what thou pleasest!’</span>
          After that they pour palm wine into one pot and water into another,
          and say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘When one has eaten, one drinks
          water.’</span> Thereby the drums sound, songs are sung, and the
          priest says: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Our father Agbasia, we pray
          thee, let us hear no more evil but good only! When women are with
          child, let them bear twins and triplets, that we may increase and
          multiply! When the time for sowing the yams comes again, make it to
          rain upon them even more than hitherto, in order that we
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name=
          "Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> may come again and
          thank thee more sincerely than hitherto!’</span> Thereupon the
          priest pours water on one of the mounds, makes a paste with it, and
          calls the people thither. Then he dips his finger in the slime and
          smears it on their brows, temples, and breasts, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘This is the slime of Agbasia, wherewith I
          smear you, that ye may remain in life.’</span> After that they
          disperse and go home.</span> Further, the prayers and offerings of
          the individual peasants on the occasion of the yam festival are
          described as follows. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the evening, when
          the town is swept clean, the people go to the fields to fetch yams,
          which, however, they may not yet bring into the town and therefore
          they hide them in the forest. As soon as the high priest quits the
          town next morning to go to the sacrificial place of his god, the
          women set out to fetch the yams which they had deposited. Now they
          begin to cook. Many people kill fowls or goats, and others buy fish
          for the festival. When the yams are sodden, a little is broken off,
          mixed with oil, and laid, together with uncooked yams, on the
          ground at the entrance to the homestead. Thereby the house-father
          says: <span class="tei tei-q">‘That belongs to all those (gods) who
          abide at the fence.’</span> He does the same under the door of the
          house and says: <span class="tei tei-q">‘That belongs to all those
          (gods) who dwell with me.’</span> Then he goes to the loom, and
          brings it its offering, and says: <span class="tei tei-q">‘That
          belongs to all the <span class="tei tei-q">“Artificers”</span> who
          have helped me in weaving.’</span> After that he lays all his
          charms on a mat spread in the house, and brings them also their
          offering, and speaks with them.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Another account describes the priestly functions of
          the house-father still more fully. Every house-father takes a raw
          piece of yam and goes with it to his loom (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">agbati</span></span>) and prays: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘May the Artificers take this yam and eat! When they
          practise their art, may it prosper!’</span> Again he takes a raw
          yam and goes with it under the house-door and prays: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘O my guardian-spirit (<span class=

          I remain healthy and nowhere feel pain! May my housemates all
          remain healthy!’</span> After he has invoked their protection on
          his family, he takes a cooked yam, crumbles it on a stone, and
          mixes it with red oil. With this mixture he goes again to the loom
          and prays <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg
          061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          as before. But even that is not the end of the worship of the
          Artificers. He again crumbles a cooked yam, but this time he does
          not mix it with red oil; he goes to the entrance of the homestead
          and prays again to the loom: <span class="tei tei-q">‘He among the
          Artificers who does not relish yams mixed with oil, let him come
          and take the white yam and eat it!’</span> From there he goes again
          under the house-door and prays: <span class="tei tei-q">‘He of my
          guardian gods and he of the watchers of the house who likes not
          yams mixed with oil, let him come and take the white yam from my
          hand and eat!’</span> From the house-door he steps into the midst
          of the chamber and says: <span class="tei tei-q">‘He who relishes
          not the yams mixed with oil, may eat the white; he who relishes not
          the white may eat the red; and he who relishes not the red may eat
          the uncooked!’</span> With this prayer he has completed his duties
          as house-priest. Just as the weaver prays to his loom, so the
          hunter prays to his musket, the smith to his hammer and anvil, and
          the carpenter to his plane and saw.</span></p>

          perform their duties to the priest of their gods. Each of these
          children receives from his parents on the morning of the Yam
          Festival two pieces of yam, which he brings to the priest of his
          god. The priest cuts off a small piece of the yam and divides the
          piece again into four pieces. The child kneels before him and lolls
          out his tongue. Holding two of these pieces of yam in his hands,
          the priest utters a prayer over the child and touches his tongue
          five times with the pieces of yam. Then the child stretches his
          hands out, each of which the priest touches five times with the
          same pieces of yam and prays as before. Then he touches both feet
          of the child five times and prays for the third time. He takes half
          of the cowry-shells which the child has brought, fastens them on a
          string, and hangs it round the child's neck. Thereby the child gets
          leave to eat new yams.</span></p>

          assault are punishable during the continuance, but the grossest
          liberty prevails, and each sex abandons itself to its
          passions.”</span> An eye-witness has described the scene at
          Coomassie, the capital: <span class="tei tei-q">“The next morning
          the King ordered a large quantity of rum to be poured into brass
          pans, in various parts of the town; the crowd pressing around, and
          drinking like hogs; freemen and slaves, women and children,
          striking, kicking, and trampling each other under foot, pushed head
          foremost into the pans, and spilling much more than they drank. In
          less than an hour, excepting the principal men, not a sober person
          was to be seen, parties of four, reeling and rolling under the
          weight of another, whom they affected to be carrying home; strings
          of women covered with red paint, hand in hand, falling down like
          rows of cards; the commonest mechanics and slaves furiously
          declaiming on state palavers; the most discordant music, the most
          obscene songs, children of both sexes prostrate in insensibility.
          All wore their handsomest cloths, which they trailed after them to
          a great length, in a drunken emulation of extravagance and
          dirtiness.”</span> About a hundred persons, mostly culprits
          reserved for the purpose, used to be sacrificed at this festival in
          Coomassie. All the chiefs killed several slaves that their blood
          might flow into the hole from which the new yam was taken. Such as
          could not afford to kill slaves took the head of a slave who had
          already been sacrificed and placed it in <span class="tei tei-pb"

          ceremonies the whole of the royal household ate new yams for the
          first time in the market-place, the King himself being in
          attendance. Next day he and his captains set off before sunrise to
          perform their annual ablutions in the river Dah; almost all the
          inhabitants of the capital followed him, so that the streets
          appeared to be deserted. The following day the King, attended by
          his suite, washed in the marsh at the south-east end of the town
          and laved the water not only over himself but also over the chairs,
          stools, gold and silver plate, and the articles of furniture which
          were set aside for his special use.<a id="noteref_194" name=

          festival of yams used to be celebrated at Coomassie in December,
          when the king or a fetish priest consecrated the new yams before

          December celebration all the laws were suspended, and every man
          might do what seemed good in his own eyes: he might even, contrary
          to custom, look at the king's wives, to the number of several
          hundreds, when they returned with the king and his suite from
          washing in the fetish water of Tana. All that day drinking went on,
          and the noise and uproar were prolonged far into the night. Early
          in the morning a human victim was sacrificed: the first man found
          near the gates of the palace was seized, butchered, and cut in
          pieces, and the executioners danced with the bleeding fragments of
          the victim in their hands or fastened round their necks. Before he
          ate of the new yams the king washed himself in fetish water brought
          from distant springs, and the chiefs performed similar

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Nandi
          of British East Africa, when the eleusine grain is ripening in
          autumn, every woman who owns a cornfield goes out into it with her
          daughters, and they all pluck some of the ripe grain. Each of the
          women then fixes one grain in her necklace and chews another, which
          she rubs on her forehead, throat, and breast. No mark of joy
          escapes them; sorrowfully they cut a basketful of the new corn, and
          carrying it home place it in the loft to dry. As the ceiling is of
          wickerwork, a good deal of the grain drops through the crevices and
          falls into the fire, where it explodes with a crackling noise. The
          people make no attempt to prevent this waste; for they regard the
          crackling of the grain in the fire as a sign that the souls of the
          dead are partaking of it. A few days later porridge is made from
          the new grain and served up with milk at the evening meal. All the
          members of the family take some of the porridge and dab it on the
          walls and roofs of the huts; also they put a little in their mouths
          and spit it out towards the east and on the outside of the huts.
          Then, holding up some of the grain in his hand, the head of the
          family prays to God for health and strength, and likewise for milk,
          and everybody present repeats the words of the prayer after

          Amongst the Baganda, when the beans were ripe, a woman would call
          her eldest son to eat some of the first which she cooked; if she
          neglected to do so, it was believed that she would incur the
          displeasure of the gods and fall ill. After the meal her husband
          jumped over her, and the beans might thereafter be eaten by

          holiness of the new fruits is well marked by the rule that they
          must be cooked in a special pot which is used only for this
          purpose, and on a new fire kindled by a magician through the
          friction of two sticks which are called <span class=

          is the shorter of the two. When the magician has kindled the new
          fire on which the new fruits are to be cooked, he hands the
          fire-sticks back to the chief, for no other hand may touch them;
          and they are then put away till they are required next season. The
          sticks are regarded as in a measure sacred, and no one, except the
          chief's personal servant, may go to the side of the hut where they
          are kept. No pot but the one used for the preparation of this feast
          may be set on a fire made by the friction of the <span class=

          Further, it is worthy of notice that the festival is described as a
          saturnalia, and we are told that <span class="tei tei-q">“a great
          deal of noise and dancing goes on, and people are not supposed to
          be responsible for what they say or do.”</span><a id="noteref_206"

          for example, among the Pondos the festival includes a period of
          license, during the continuance of which the chief abdicates his
          functions and any crime may be committed with impunity. The
          description of the Pondo festival comprises so many interesting
          features that I will reproduce it entire. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“When a Pondo chief is to hold the feast of
          first-fruits, some of his people procure a ripe plant of the gourd
          family, pumpkin or calabash, from another tribe. This is cooked;
          the inside cleaned out, and the rind made ready for use as a
          vessel. It is then presented to the chief with much ceremony. The
          first-fruits are now brought forward, and a sacrifice, generally a
          young bull, is offered, after which the feast commences. The chief
          issues certain orders for the conduct of the proceedings, tastes
          the fruits which are served in the gourd-dish with which he has
          been presented, and then abdicates all his functions while the
          festival lasts. The cattle from all the neighbouring villages are
          collected in the vicinity, and now they are brought together, and
          the bulls incited to fight to determine which is to be king among
          them for the next year. The young people engage in games and
          dances, feats of strength and running. After these are over the
          whole community give themselves over to disorder, debauchery, and
          riot. In their bull-fights and games they but did honour to the
          powers of nature, and now, as they eat and drink, the same powers
          are honoured in another form and by other rites. There is no one in
          authority to keep order, and every man does what seems good in his
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name=
          "Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> own eyes. Should a
          man stab his neighbour he escapes all punishment, and so too with
          all other crimes against the person, property, and morality. People
          are even permitted to abuse the chief to his face, an offence which
          at any other time would meet with summary vengeance and an
          unceremonious dispatch to join the ancestors. While the feast
          continues, a deafening noise is kept up by drumming, shouting,
          hand-clapping, and every kind of instrument that can be made to
          emit sound. Men advance to the chief and explain their origin, and
          also the object they hold sacred, by imitating the sounds and
          movements of their most sacred animal. This is the person's totem.
          Others imitate the gurgling made by an enemy when stabbed in the

          ceremonies, revels, and mummeries are ended, the chief repairs to
          his accustomed place, and sitting down there, by that act resumes
          his kingly functions. He calls the bravest of his braves before
          him, who is immediately clothed and decorated with skins of animals
          suggestive of courage and strategy. He performs a dance amid the
          frenzied shouting of the multitude, after which the chief declares
          the festival at an end and harvest commenced.”</span><a id=

          Another writer, speaking of the Zulu festival of first-fruits as it
          was celebrated in the time of the ferocious despot Chaka, says that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“at this period the chiefs are allowed to
          converse unreservedly with the king, speaking with great freedom,
          and in some measure to be dictatorial.”</span><a id="noteref_208"

          Again, another traveller, who visited the Zulus in the reign of
          King Panda, tells us that <span class="tei tei-q">“in spite of the
          practice of the most absolute despotism there are three days in the
          year when the nation in its turn has the right to call the king to
          a severe account for his acts. It is at the general assembly of the
          warriors, when the maize is ripe, that the lively discussions take
          place and the questions are put to which the king must answer at
          once in a manner satisfactory to the people. I have then seen
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name=
          "Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> simple warriors come
          leaping from the ranks, assume the style of fluent and excessively
          energetic orators, and not only confront the fiery glare of Panda,
          but even attack him before everybody, blame his acts, call them
          infamous and base, compel him to vindicate his conduct, and then
          refute his vindication by dissecting it and exposing its falsehood,
          finally proceeding to haughty threats and winding up the harangue
          with a gesture of contempt.”</span><a id="noteref_209" name=
          "noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a> Such
          liberties taken with the despotic Zulu kings seem to point to a
          time when they too, like the Pondo chiefs, abdicated or were
          deposed during the festival. Perhaps we may even go a step further.
          We have seen that on this occasion the Zulu king dances in a mantle
          of grass or of herbs and corn-leaves, which is afterwards burnt and
          the ashes scattered and trodden into the ground. This custom seems
          clearly intended to promote the fertility of the earth, and in
          earlier times the same end may have been compassed by burning the
          king himself and dispersing his ashes; for we have seen that a
          Bechuana tribe, of the same Bantu stock as the Zulus, were wont to
          sacrifice a human victim for the good of the crops and to scatter
          his ashes over the ground.<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210"

          this connexion it should be borne in mind that we have found
          independent evidence of a custom of putting the Zulu king to death
          whenever his bodily strength began to fail.<a id="noteref_211"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Bechuanas it is a rule that before they partake of the new crops
          they must purify themselves. The purification takes place at the
          commencement of the new year on a day in January which is fixed by
          the chief. It begins in the great kraal of the tribe, where all the
          adult males assemble. Each of them takes in his hand leaves of a
          gourd called by the natives <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">lerotse</span></span> (described as something
          between a pumpkin and a vegetable marrow); and having crushed the
          leaves he anoints with the expressed juice his big toes and his
          navel; many people indeed apply the juice to all the joints of
          their body, but the better-informed say that this is a vulgar
          departure from ancient custom. After this ceremony in the great
          kraal every man goes home to his own kraal, assembles all the
          members of his family, men, women, and children, and smears them
          all with the juice of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lerotse</span></span>
          leaves. Some of the leaves are also pounded, mixed with milk in a
          large wooden dish, and given to the dogs to lap up. Then the
          porridge plate of each member of the family is rubbed with the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">lerotse</span></span> leaves. When this
          purification has been completed, but not before, the people are
          free to eat of the new crops. On the night after the purification
          every man was bound, as a matter of ritual, to sleep with his chief
          wife. If she had been unfaithful to him during the past year, it
          was incumbent on her to confess her sin before she fulfilled her
          part of the ceremony. Having confessed she was purified by a
          medicine-man, who fumigated her with the smoke produced by burning
          a bean plant. Thereupon husband and wife cut each other slightly
          under the navel, and each of them rubbed his or her blood, mixed
          with <span class="tei tei-q">“medicine,”</span> into the other's
          wound. That completed the purification of the woman, and the pair
          might now proceed with the rest of the rite. Should a married man
          be from home at the time when the annual purification <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ceremony is performed, he is thought to
          be in a very sad plight; indeed his chances of surviving for
          another year are supposed to be small. On his return home, he dare
          not enter his own house, for he would pollute it, and if even his
          shadow were to fall on one of his children, the child would die. He
          must wait till his wife comes to him and brings him a calabash of
          water to drink, which is a sign that she has waited for his return
          to perform the rite of purification together. But if she does not
          bring the water, he knows that in his absence she has performed the
          rite with some other man, and it becomes necessary to purge her by
          means of fumigation and blood-letting, as described before. But
          even when that purgation is completed, husband and wife may not
          indulge in connubial intercourse for the rest of the year, that is,
          until the next annual purification has taken place. The Bechuanas
          think that <span class="tei tei-q">“any breach of this rule will be
          punished with supernatural penalties—the husband, wife, or child
          will die.”</span><a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href=

          this occasion the regiments assembled at Bulawayo, the capital, and
          danced in a great semicircle before the king, who occasionally
          joined in the dance. When he did so, the medicine-men and their
          satellites, armed with thorn-bushes, rushed about among the dancers
          and incited them to fresh <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg

          such as seemed to flag. The king's wives also sang and danced
          before him in long lines, holding the marriage ring in their right
          hands and green boughs in their left. On the third day of the
          festival hundreds of oxen were sacrificed: the flesh and blood of
          the black or sacred cattle were converted into charms; while the
          carcases of the rest were cut up and distributed among the people,
          who feasted upon them. The fourth day was specially set apart for
          the ceremony of the first-fruits. In the morning all the people
          went down to the river to wash, and on their return a witch-doctor
          or medicine-man took a dish of the new vegetables and corn, mixed
          with charms, and scattered the contents by handfuls among the
          crowd, who seized and ate them. After that the people were free to
          eat the new crops. According to one account, this festival of
          first-fruits was held at the first full moon which followed the
          summer solstice (the twenty-first of December in the southern
          hemisphere); according to another account, it took place a few days
          after the full moon of February, which marked the beginning of the

          of the new harvest. Sometimes each town had its own busk; sometimes
          several towns united to hold one in common. Before celebrating the
          busk, the people provided themselves with new clothes and new
          household utensils and furniture; they collected their old clothes
          and rubbish, together with all the remaining grain and other old
          provisions, cast them together in one <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          preparation for the ceremony, all the fires in the village were
          extinguished, and the ashes swept clean away. In particular, the
          hearth or altar of the temple was dug up and the ashes carried out.
          Then the chief priest put some roots of the button-snake plant,
          with some green tobacco leaves and a little of the new fruits, at
          the bottom of the fireplace, which he afterwards commanded to be
          covered up with white clay, and wetted over with clean water. A
          thick arbour of green branches of young trees was then made over
          the altar.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href=

          Meanwhile the women at home were cleaning out their houses,

          fruits.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href=

          public or sacred square was carefully swept of even the smallest
          crumbs of previous feasts, <span class="tei tei-q">“for fear of
          polluting the first-fruit offerings.”</span> Also every vessel that
          had contained or had been used about any food during the expiring
          year was removed from the temple before sunset. Then all the men
          who were not known to have violated the law of the first-fruit
          offering and that of marriage during the year were summoned by a
          crier to enter the holy square and observe a solemn fast. But the
          women (except six old ones), the children, and all who had not
          attained the rank of warriors were forbidden to enter the square.
          Sentinels were also posted at the corners of the square to keep out
          all persons deemed impure and all animals. A strict fast was then
          observed for two nights and a day, the devotees drinking a bitter
          decoction of button-snake root <span class="tei tei-q">“in order to
          vomit and purge their sinful bodies.”</span> That the people
          outside the square might also be purified, one of the old men laid
          down a quantity of green tobacco at a corner of the square; this
          was carried off by an old woman and distributed to the people
          without, who chewed and swallowed it <span class="tei tei-q">“in
          order to afflict their souls.”</span> During this general fast, the
          women, children, and men of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> weak constitution were allowed to eat after
          mid-day, but not before. On the morning when the fast ended, the
          women brought a quantity of the old year's food to the outside of
          the sacred square. These provisions were then fetched in and set
          before the famished multitude, but all traces of them had to be
          removed before noon. When the sun was declining from the meridian,
          all the people were commanded by the voice of a crier to stay
          within doors, to do no bad act, and to be sure to extinguish and
          throw away every spark of the old fire. Universal silence now
          reigned. Then the high priest made the new fire by the friction of
          two pieces of wood, and placed it on the altar under the green
          arbour. This new fire was believed to atone for all past crimes
          except murder. Next a basket of new fruits was brought; the high
          priest took out a little of each sort of fruit, rubbed it with
          bear's oil, and offered it, together with some flesh, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to the bountiful holy spirit of fire, as a first-fruit
          offering, and an annual oblation for sin.”</span> He also
          consecrated the sacred emetics (the button-snake root and the
          cassina or black-drink) by pouring a little of them into the fire.
          The persons who had remained outside now approached, without
          entering, the sacred square; and the chief priest thereupon made a
          speech, exhorting the people to observe their old rites and
          customs, announcing that the new divine fire had purged away the
          sins of the past year, and earnestly warning the women that, if any
          of them had not extinguished the old fire, or had contracted any
          impurity, they must forthwith depart, <span class="tei tei-q">“lest
          the divine fire should spoil both them and the people.”</span> Some
          of the new fire was then set down outside the holy square; the
          women carried it home joyfully, and laid it on their unpolluted
          hearths. When several towns had united to celebrate the festival,
          the new fire might thus be carried for several miles. The new
          fruits were then dressed on the new fires and eaten with bear's
          oil, which was deemed indispensable. At one point of the festival
          the men rubbed the new corn between their hands, then on their
          faces and breasts.<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href=

          During the festival which followed, the warriors, dressed in their
          wild martial array, their heads covered with white down and
          carrying white <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg
          075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          feathers in their hands, danced round the sacred arbour, under
          which burned the new fire. The ceremonies lasted eight days, during
          which the strictest continence was practised. Towards the
          conclusion of the festival the warriors fought a mock battle; then
          the men and women together, in three circles, danced round the
          sacred fire. Lastly, all the people smeared themselves with white
          clay and bathed in running water. They came out of the water
          believing that no evil could now befall them for what they had done
          amiss in the past. So they departed in joy and peace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ceremonies of
          the same general type are still annually observed by the Yuchi
          Indians of Oklahoma, who belong to the Creek nation but speak a
          different language. The rites are said to have been instituted by
          the Sun. They are solemnised in the public square, and are timed so
          as to coincide with the ripening of the corn, which usually takes
          place about the middle or early part of July. Continence and
          abstinence from salt are prescribed during their celebration, and
          all the men must fast for twelve hours before they take the emetic.
          A sacred new fire is kindled by striking two stones against each
          other, after which all the males are scarified or scratched by an
          official on the arm or breast, so as to let blood flow and drip on
          the ground of the public square. This bleeding of the men is said
          to be symbolical of the origin of the Yuchi people; for the first
          Yuchi sprang from some drops of blood which the mother of the Sun
          let fall on earth at one of her monthly periods. Hence the Yuchi
          call themselves the Children of the Sun. The solemn rite of
          scratching is followed by the no less solemn rite of vomiting. This
          also was instituted by the Sun. He taught the Indians to steep the
          button-snake root and the red root in water and to drink the
          decoction, in order that they might vomit and so purify their
          bodies against sickness during the ensuing year. They think that if
          they did not thus purge themselves before eating the new corn, they
          would fall sick. The chief of the town is charged with the solemn
          duty of preparing the nauseous concoction, and he is assisted by
          four boys who have been initiated into the mysteries. The pots
          containing the stuff are decorated on the rim with a pattern
          representing the sun, and they stand east of the fire near
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name=
          "Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the middle of the
          public square. The order of drinking is regulated by the rank of
          the drinkers. When the sun is about the zenith, the four noblest
          come forward, face eastward, and gulp down the vile but salutary
          potion; then they retire to their places and await the usual
          results. When they feel the inward workings of the draught, they
          step out of the square and discharge the contents of their stomachs
          in a place set apart for the purpose. They are followed by another
          party of four, and that by another, and so on, till all the men
          have thus purged themselves. The rite is repeated several times.
          When it is over, they all go to water and wash off the paint with
          which they were adorned; then returning to their places in the
          square they feast on the new corn. After a rest of some hours the
          men engage in ball play, not as a mere recreation but as a matter
          of ritual. Sides are chosen; every player is equipped with two
          rackets, and the aim of each side is to drive the ball through
          their opponents' goal, which consists of two uprights and a
          cross-piece. The two goals stand east and west of each other.
          During the following night dancing is kept up, and a general
          laxity, degenerating into debauchery, prevails; but parents and
          elders wink at the excesses of the young folk. Among the dances are
          some in which the dancers mimick the motions and cries of their
          totemic animals, such as ducks, buzzards, rabbits, fish, buffaloes,
          chickens, and owls.<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href=

          an annual purification and festival called the Green Corn Dance, at
          which the new corn is eaten. On the evening of the first day of the

          cannot safely eat the new green corn, and besides that he will be
          sick at some time in the year. While the liquor is being drunk, the
          dancing begins, and the medicine-men join in it. Next day they eat
          of the green corn; the following <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Further, the Natchez Indians, another tribe of the same stock, who
          used to inhabit a district on the lower course and eastern bank of
          the Mississippi, ate the new corn sacramentally at a great festival
          which has been fully described by Du Pratz, the French historian of
          Louisiana. As his work is probably not easily accessible to many of
          my readers, I shall perhaps consult their convenience by extracting
          his description entire. The Natchez, he tells us, began their year
          in March and divided it into thirteen moons. Their sixth moon,
          which answered to our August, was the Mulberry Moon, and the
          seventh was the moon of Maize or Great Corn. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This feast is beyond dispute the most solemn of all.
          It principally consists in eating in common, and in a religious
          manner, of new corn, which had been sown expressly with that
          design, with suitable ceremonies. This corn is sown upon a spot of
          ground never before cultivated; which ground is dressed and
          prepared by the warriors alone, who also are the only persons that
          sow the corn, weed it, reap it, and gather it. When this corn is
          near ripe, the warriors fix on a place proper for the general
          feast, and close adjoining to that they form a round granary, the
          bottom and sides of which are of cane; this they fill with the
          corn, and when they have finished the harvest, and covered the
          granary, they acquaint the Great Sun,<a id="noteref_224" name=
          "noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> who
          appoints the day for the general feast. Some days before the feast,
          they build huts for the Great Sun, and for all the other families,
          round the granary, that of the Great Sun being raised upon a mound
          of earth about two feet high. On the feast-day the whole nation set
          out from their village at sun-rising, leaving behind only the aged
          and infirm that are not able to travel, and a few warriors, who are
          to carry the Great Sun on a litter upon their shoulders.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name=
          "Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The seat of this
          litter is covered with several deer-skins, and to its four sides
          are fastened four bars which cross each other, and are supported by
          eight men, who at every hundred paces transfer their burden to
          eight other men, and thus successively transport it to the place
          where the feast is celebrated, which may be near two miles from the
          village. About nine o'clock the Great Sun comes out of his hut
          dressed in the ornaments of his dignity, and being placed in his
          litter, which has a canopy at the head formed of flowers, he is
          carried in a few minutes to the sacred granary, shouts of joy
          re-echoing on all sides. Before he alights he makes the tour of the
          whole place deliberately, and when he comes before the corn, he
          salutes it thrice with the words <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">hoo, hoo,
          hoo</span></span>, lengthened and pronounced respectfully. The
          salutation is repeated by the whole nation, who pronounce the word
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hoo</span></span> nine times distinctly, and
          at the ninth time he alights and places himself on his
          throne.</span></p>

          pieces of wood violently against each other, and when everything is
          prepared for dressing the corn, the chief of war, accompanied by
          the warriors belonging to each family, presents himself before the
          throne, and addresses the Sun in these words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Speak, for I hear thee.’</span> The sovereign then
          rises up, bows towards the four quarters of the world, and
          advancing to the granary, lifts his eyes and hands to heaven, and
          says, 'Give us corn': upon which the great chief of war, the
          princes and princesses, and all the men, thank him separately by
          pronouncing the word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hoo</span></span>. The corn is then
          distributed, first to the female Suns, and then to all the women,
          who run with it to their huts, and dress it with the utmost
          dispatch. When the corn is dressed in all the huts, a plate of it
          is put into the hands of the Great Sun, who presents it to the four
          quarters of the world, and then says to the chief of war,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Eat’</span>; upon this signal the warriors
          begin to eat in all the huts; after them the boys of whatever age,

          When the warriors have finished their repast, they form themselves
          into two choirs before the huts, and sing war songs for half an
          hour; after which the chief of war, and all the warriors in
          succession, recount their brave <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the number of enemies they have slain. The youths are next allowed
          to harangue, and each tells in the best manner he can, not what he
          has done, but what he intends to do; and if his discourse merits
          approbation, he is answered by a general <span class=

          following is the disposition of their dance. A man places himself
          on the ground with a pot covered with a deer-skin, in the manner of
          a drum, to beat time to the dancers; round him the women form
          themselves into a circle, not joining hands, but at some distance

          daughters to pluck a small bundle of these and prepare them for

          elder, or medicine-man as the case may be, and his assistants being

          the suckers. While the invocation is being made all in the circle
          must keep their eyes reverently closed, this being an essential
          part in all such ceremonies, the non-observance of which would
          anger the spirits and cause them to withhold the favours sought. To
          ensure this being strictly done, the assisting elders are armed
          with long wands with which they strike any person found opening his
          eyes during the prayer. After this part of the ceremony is over the
          cooked suckers are handed to the presiding officer in a newly
          carved dish, and a small portion is given to each person present,
          who reverently and decorously eats it. This brings the ceremony to
          a close. Later, when the berries of this plant are ripe, a second
          and similar ceremony takes place.”</span><a id="noteref_226" name=

          but they used to regard it as a mysterious being, and observed a
          number of taboos in connexion with it; for example, women who were
          engaged in digging or cooking the root must practise continence,
          and no man might come near the oven where the women were baking the
          root. When young people ate the first berries, roots, or other

          outside the lodge and generally after sunset, and caused all the
          adult men and women, who were in the habit of smoking, to sit down
          in a circle, while he stood in the middle. Sometimes he made a long

          following the sun's course. Everybody took one whiff, and holding
          up his or her hands, the palms close together, blew the smoke
          downwards between the fingers and over the breast; and as the smoke
          descended, he crossed his hands on his breast, and rubbing his
          chest and shoulders with both hands, as if he were rubbing the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These customs of
          the Thompson and other Indian tribes of North-West America are
          instructive, because they clearly indicate the motive, or at least
          one of the motives, which underlies the ceremonies observed at
          eating the first fruits of the season. That motive in the case of
          these Indians is simply a belief that the plant itself is animated
          by a conscious and more or less powerful spirit, who must be
          propitiated before the people can safely partake of the fruits or
          roots which are supposed to be part of his body. Now if this is
          true of wild fruits and roots, we may infer with some probability
          that it is also true of cultivated fruits and roots, such as yams,
          and in particular that it holds good of the cereals, such as wheat,
          barley, oats, rice, and maize. In all cases it seems reasonable to
          infer that the scruples which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> savages manifest at eating the first fruits
          of any crop, and the ceremonies which they observe before they
          overcome their scruples, are due at least in large measure to a
          notion that the plant or tree is animated by a spirit or even a
          deity, whose leave must be obtained, or whose favour must be sought
          before it is possible to partake with safety of the new crop. This
          indeed is plainly affirmed of the Aino: they call the millet
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the divine cereal,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the cereal deity,”</span> and they pray to and worship

          even where the indwelling divinity of the first fruits is not
          expressly affirmed, it appears to be implied both by the solemn
          preparations made for eating them and by the danger supposed to be
          incurred by persons who venture to partake of them without
          observing the prescribed ritual. In all such cases, accordingly, we
          may not improperly describe the eating of the new fruits as a
          sacrament or communion with a deity, or at all events with a
          powerful spirit.</p>

          the practice of purifying the persons of the communicants and even

          all the modes of purification adopted on these occasions none
          perhaps brings out the sacramental virtue of the rite so clearly as
          the Creek and Seminole practice of taking a purgative before
          swallowing the new corn. The intention is thereby to prevent the
          sacred food from being polluted by contact with common food in the
          stomach of the eater. For the same reason Catholics partake of the
          Eucharist fasting; and among the pastoral Masai of Eastern Africa
          the young warriors, who live on meat and milk exclusively, are
          obliged to eat nothing but milk for so many days and then nothing
          but meat for so many more, and before they pass from the one food
          to the other they must make sure that none of the old food remains
          in their stomachs; this they do by swallowing a very powerful
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name=
          "Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> purgative and

          Similarly, among the Suk, a tribe of British East Africa, no one
          may partake of meat and milk on the same day, and if he has chewed
          raw millet he is forbidden to drink milk for seven days.<a id=

          the Wataturu, another people of Eastern Africa akin to the Masai, a
          warrior who had eaten antelope's flesh might not drink of milk on
          the same day.<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href=

          Similarly among the Central Esquimaux the rules prohibiting contact
          between venison and the flesh of marine animals are very strict.
          The Esquimaux themselves say that the goddess Sedna dislikes the
          deer, and therefore they may not bring that animal into contact
          with her favourites, the sea beasts. Hence the meat of the whale,
          the seal, or the walrus may not be eaten on the same day with
          venison. Both sorts of meat may not even lie on the floor of the
          hut or behind the lamps at the same time. If a man who has eaten
          venison in the morning happens to enter a hut in which the flesh of
          seal is being cooked, he is allowed to eat venison on the bed, but
          it must be wrapt up before being carried into the hut, and he must
          take care to keep clear of the floor. Before changing from one food
          to the other the Esquimaux must wash themselves.<a id="noteref_234"
          name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class=

          Again, just as the Esquimaux think that their <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> goddess would be offended if venison
          met seal or whale or walrus meat in the eater's stomach, so the
          Melanesians of Florida, one of the Solomon Islands, believe that if
          a man who has eaten pork or fish or shell-fish or the flesh of a
          certain sort of cuscus were to enter a garden immediately
          afterwards, the ghosts who preside over the garden and cause the
          fruits to grow would be angry and the crop would consequently
          suffer; but three or four days after partaking of such victuals,
          when the food has quite left his stomach, he may enter the garden
          without offence to the ghosts or injury to the crop.<a id=
          "noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href="#note_235"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a> In
          like manner the ancient Greeks, of whose intellectual kinship with
          savages like the Esquimaux and the Melanesians we have already met
          with many proofs, laid it down as a rule that a man who had
          partaken of the black ram offered to Pelops at Olympia might not
          enter into the temple of Zeus, and that persons who had sacrificed
          to Telephus at Pergamus might not go up to the temple of
          Aesculapius until they had washed themselves,<a id="noteref_236"
          name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a> just
          as the Esquimaux who have eaten venison must wash before they may
          partake of seal or whale or walrus meat. Again, at Lindus in Rhodes
          there was a sanctuary of some god or hero unknown into which no one
          who had partaken of goat's flesh or peas-pudding might enter for
          three days, and no one who had eaten cheese might enter for one
          day.<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href=
          "#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a> The
          prescribed interval was probably calculated to allow the obnoxious
          food to pass out of the body of the eater before he entered into
          the presence of the deity, who for some reason or other cherished
          an antipathy to these particular viands. At Castabus in the Carian
          Chersonese there was a sanctuary of Hemithea, which no one might
          approach who had either eaten pork or touched a pig.<a id=

          in course of time the sacrifice of first-fruits tends to throw the

          higher powers having received their share, man is free to enjoy the

          eating bread sacramentally as the body of a god was practised by
          the Aztecs before the discovery and conquest of Mexico by the
          Spaniards. Twice a year, in May and December, an image of the great

          then broken in pieces, and solemnly eaten by his worshippers. The
          May ceremony is thus described by the historian Acosta:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Mexicans in the month of May made
          their principal feast to their god Vitzilipuztli, and two days
          before this feast, the virgins whereof I have spoken (the which
          were shut up and secluded in the same temple and were as it were
          religious women) did mingle a quantity of the seed of beets with
          roasted maize, and then they did mould it with honey, making an
          idol of that paste in bigness like to that of wood, putting instead
          of eyes grains of green glass, of blue or white; and for teeth
          grains of maize set forth with all the ornament and furniture that
          I have said. This being finished, all the noblemen came and brought
          it an exquisite and rich garment, like unto that of the idol,
          wherewith they did attire it. Being thus clad and deckt, they did
          set it in an azured chair and in a litter to carry it on their
          shoulders. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg

          The morning of this feast being come, an hour before day all the
          maidens came forth attired in white, with new ornaments, the which
          that day were called the Sisters of their god Vitzilipuztli, they
          came crowned with garlands of maize roasted and parched, being like
          unto azahar or the flower of orange; and about their necks they had
          great chains of the same, which went bauldrickwise under their left
          arm. Their cheeks were dyed with vermilion, their arms from the
          elbow to the wrist were covered with red parrots' feathers.”</span>
          Young men, dressed in red robes and crowned like the virgins with
          maize, then carried the idol in its litter to the foot of the great

          people stood in the court with much reverence and fear. Being
          mounted to the top, and that they had placed it in a little lodge
          of roses which they held ready, presently came the young men, which
          strewed many flowers of sundry kinds, wherewith they filled the
          temple both within and without. This done, all the virgins came out
          of their convent, bringing pieces of paste compounded of beets and
          roasted maize, which was of the same paste whereof their idol was
          made and compounded, and they were of the fashion of great bones.
          They delivered them to the young men, who carried them up and laid
          them at the idol's feet, wherewith they filled the whole place that
          it could receive no more. They called these morsels of paste the
          flesh and bones of Vitzilipuztli. Having laid abroad these bones,
          presently came all the ancients of the temple, priests, Levites,
          and all the rest of the ministers, according to their dignities and

          after another, with their veils of diverse colours and works, every
          one according to his dignity and office, having garlands upon their
          heads and chains of flowers about their necks; after them came
          their gods and goddesses whom they worshipped, of diverse figures,
          attired in the same livery; then putting themselves in order about
          those morsels and pieces of paste, they used certain ceremonies
          with singing and dancing. By means whereof they were blessed and
          consecrated for the flesh and bones of this idol. This <span class=

          was lawful for them to eat anything. During the time of this

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this
          interesting passage we learn that the ancient Mexicans, even before
          the arrival of Christian missionaries, were fully acquainted with
          the theological doctrine of transubstantiation and acted upon it in
          the solemn rites of their religion. They believed that by
          consecrating bread their priests could turn it into the very body
          of their god, so that all who thereupon partook of the consecrated
          bread entered into a mystic communion with the deity by receiving a
          portion of his divine substance into themselves. The doctrine of
          transubstantiation, or the magical conversion of bread into flesh,
          was also familiar to the Aryans of ancient India long before the
          spread and even the rise of Christianity. The Brahmans taught that
          the rice-cakes offered in sacrifice were substitutes for human
          beings, and that they were actually converted into the real bodies
          of men by the manipulation of the priest. We read that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“when it (the rice-cake) still consists of rice-meal,
          it is the hair. When he pours water on it, it becomes skin. When he
          mixes it, it becomes flesh: for then it becomes consistent; and
          consistent also is the flesh. When it is baked, it becomes bone:
          for then it becomes somewhat hard; and hard is the bone. And when
          he is about to take it off (the fire) and sprinkles it with butter,
          he changes it into marrow. This is the completeness which they call
          the fivefold animal sacrifice.”</span><a id="noteref_242" name=

          remarkable transformations, daily wrought by the priest, on the
          rice-wafer, were, however, nothing at all to those which the gods
          themselves accomplished when <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          into a camel; and the goat was converted into a remarkable species
          of deer, enriched with eight legs, which slew lions and
          elephants.<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href=

          the whole it would seem that neither the ancient Hindoos nor the
          ancient Mexicans had much to learn from the most refined mysteries
          of Catholic theology.</p>

          consecrated bread which they revered as the very flesh and bones of
          their God, and why up till noon they might drink nothing at all,
          not even water. They feared no doubt to defile the portion of God
          in their stomachs by contact with common things. A similar pious
          fear led the Creek and Seminole Indians, as we saw, to adopt the
          more thoroughgoing expedient of rinsing out their insides by a
          strong purgative before they dared to partake of the sacrament of

          preparation for this solemn ceremony an image of the deity in the
          likeness of a man was fashioned out of seeds of various sorts,
          which were kneaded into a dough with the blood of children. The
          bones of the god were represented by pieces of acacia wood. This
          image was placed on the chief altar of the temple, and on the day
          of the festival the king offered incense to it. Early next day it
          was taken down and set on its feet in a great hall. Then a priest,
          who bore the name and acted the part of the god Quetzalcoatl, took
          a flint-tipped dart and hurled it into the breast of the
          dough-image, piercing it through and through. This was called

          fashioned five, others ten, others as many as fifteen of them.

          outward and visible shape of bread or grain; it was not even enough
          that this material vehicle of the divine life should be kneaded and
          fortified with human blood. They craved, as it seems, after a
          closer union with the living god, and attained it by devouring the
          flesh of a real man, who, after he had paraded for a time in the
          trappings and received the honours of a god, was slaughtered and
          eaten by his cannibal worshippers. The deity thus consumed in
          effigy was Tetzcatlipoca, and the man chosen to represent him and
          die in his stead was a young captive of handsome person and
          illustrious birth. During his captivity the youth thus doomed to
          play the fatal part of divinity was allowed to range the streets of
          Mexico freely, escorted by a distinguished train, who paid him as
          much respect as if he had been indeed the god himself instead of
          only his living image. Twenty days before the festival at which the
          tragic mockery was to end, that he might taste all the joys of this
          transient world to which he must soon bid farewell, he received in
          marriage four women, from whom he parted only when he took his
          place in the last solemn procession. Arrived at the foot of the
          sacred pyramid on the top of which he was to die, the sacrificers
          saluted him and led him up the long staircase. On the summit five
          of them seized him and held him down on his back upon the

          he was about to kill, cut open his breast and tore out the
          throbbing heart with the accustomed rites. But instead of being
          kicked down the staircase and sent rolling from step to step like
          the corpses of common victims, the body of the dead god was carried
          respectfully down, and his flesh, chopped up small, was distributed
          among the priests and nobles as a blessed food. The head, being
          severed from the trunk, was preserved in a sacred place along with
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name=

          valley, at the foot of a beetling crag of red rock, they have a
          small thatched temple of the God of fire, and here down to recent
          years stood a small image of the deity in human form roughly carved
          out of solidified volcanic ash. The idol was very dirty and smeared
          with blood, and in his right side was a hole, which owed its
          existence to the piety and devotion of his worshippers. For they
          believed that the power of healing and a knowledge of mysteries
          could be acquired by eating a little of the god's holy body, and
          accordingly shamans, or medicine-men, who desired to lay in a stock
          of these accomplishments, so useful in the exercise of their
          profession, were wont to repair to the temple, where, having
          deposited an offering of food or a votive bowl, they scraped off
          with their finger-nails some particles of the god's body and
          swallowed them. After engaging in this form of communion with the
          deity they had to abstain from salt and from all carnal converse

          takes place at marriage. An image of the goddess in the form of a
          truncated cone is made out of rice and green grain cooked together,
          and it is decorated with a nose jewel, garlands, and other
          religious symbols. Offerings of rice, frankincense, camphor, and a
          coco-nut are then made to the image, and a ram or he-goat is
          sacrificed. After the sacrifice has been presented, all the persons
          assembled prostrate themselves in silence before the image, then
          they break it in pieces, and distributing the pieces among
          themselves they swallow them. In this way they are, no doubt,
          believed to absorb the divine <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Europe the Catholic Church has resorted to similar means for
          enabling the pious to enjoy the ineffable privilege of eating the
          persons of the Infant God and his Mother. For this purpose images
          of the Madonna are printed on some soluble and harmless substance
          and sold in sheets like postage stamps. The worshipper buys as many
          of these sacred emblems as he has occasion for, and affixing one or
          more of them to his food swallows the bolus. The practice is not
          confined to the poor and ignorant. In his youth Count von
          Hoensbroech and his devout mother used thus to consume portions of
          God and his Mother with their meals.<a id="noteref_253" name=

          whom woollen effigies of men and women were dedicated at the
          festival of the Compitalia. These effigies were hung at the doors
          of all the houses in Rome; one effigy was hung up for every free
          person in the house, and one effigy, of a different kind, for every
          slave. The reason was that on this day the ghosts of the dead were
          believed to be going about, and it was hoped that, either out of
          good nature or through simple inadvertence, they would carry off
          the effigies at the door instead of the living people <span class=

          these woollen figures were substitutes for a former custom of
          sacrificing human beings.<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257"

          data so fragmentary and uncertain, it is impossible to build with
          confidence; but it seems worth suggesting that the loaves in human
          form, which appear to have been baked at Aricia, were sacramental
          bread, and that in the old days, when the divine King of the Wood
          was annually slain, loaves were made in his image, like the paste
          figures of the gods in Mexico, India, and Europe, and were eaten
          sacramentally by his worshippers.<a id="noteref_258" name=

          Mexican sacraments in honour of Huitzilopochtli were also
          accompanied by the sacrifice of human victims. The tradition that
          the founder of the sacred grove at Aricia was a man named Manius,
          from whom many Manii were descended, would thus be an etymological
          myth invented to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg

          applied to these sacramental loaves. A dim recollection of the
          original connexion of the loaves with human sacrifices may perhaps
          be traced in the story that the effigies dedicated to Mania at the
          Compitalia were substitutes for human victims. The story itself,
          however, is probably devoid of foundation, since the practice of
          putting up dummies to divert the attention of ghosts or demons from
          living people is not uncommon. As the practice is both widely
          spread and very characteristic of the manner of thought of
          primitive man, who tries in a thousand ways to outwit the malice of
          spiritual beings, I may be pardoned for devoting a few pages to its
          illustration, even though in doing so I diverge somewhat from the
          strict line of argument. I would ask the reader to observe that the
          vicarious use of images, with which we are here concerned, differs
          wholly in principle from the sympathetic use of them which we
          examined before;<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href=

          that while the sympathetic use belongs purely to magic, the
          vicarious use falls within the domain of religion.</p>

          is dressed in golden-yellow robes, holds a golden noose in her
          hand, and rides on a ram. In order to bar the dwelling-house
          against the foul fiends, of whom Old Mother Khön-ma is mistress, an
          elaborate structure somewhat resembling a chandelier is fixed above
          the door on the outside of the house. It contains a ram's skull, a

          resorts to the device of making up of dummies or effigies which he
          puts in the way of the ghost, hoping that the dull-witted spirit
          will mistake them for real people and so leave the survivors in
          peace. Hence in Tahiti the priest who performed the funeral rites
          used to lay some slips of plantain leaf-stalk on the breast and

          tie up a piece of banana-trunk loosely in leaves and lay it on her
          bosom in the grave. So away she goes, thinking she has her baby
          with her, and as she goes the banana-stalk keeps slipping about in
          the leaves, and she fancies it is the child stirring at her breast.
          Thus she is happy, till she comes to ghost-land and finds she has

          town on the left bank of the Niger, a missionary once met a funeral
          procession which he describes as very singular. The real body had
          already been buried in the house, but a piece of wood in the form
          of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name=
          "Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sofa and covered up
          was being borne by two persons on their heads, attended by a
          procession of six men and six women. The men carried cutlasses and
          the women clapped their hands as they passed along each street,
          crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the dead body of him that
          is dead, and is gone into the world of spirits.”</span> Meantime
          the rest of the villagers had to keep indoors.<a id="noteref_269"

          sham corpse was probably intended as a lure to draw away prowling
          demons from the real body. So among the Angoni, who inhabit the
          western bank of Lake Nyassa, there is a common belief that demons
          hover about the dying and dead before burial in order to snatch
          away their souls to join their own evil order. Guns are fired and
          drums are beaten to repel these spiritual foes, but a surer way of
          baulking their machinations is to have a mock funeral and so
          mislead and confound them. A sham corpse is made up out of anything
          that comes to hand, and it is treated exactly as if it were what it
          pretends to be. This lay figure is then carried some distance to a
          grave, followed by a great crowd weeping and wailing as if their
          hearts would break, while the rub-a-dub of drums and the discharge
          of guns add to the uproar. Meantime the real corpse is being
          interred as quietly and stealthily as possible near the house. Thus
          the demons are baffled; for when the dummy corpse has been laid in
          the earth with every mark of respect, and the noisy crowd has
          dispersed, the fiends swoop down on the mock grave only to find a
          bundle of rushes or some such trash in it; but the true grave they
          do not know and cannot find.<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270"

          Similarly among the Bakundu of the Cameroons two graves are always
          made, one in the hut of the deceased and another somewhere else,
          and no one knows where the corpse is really buried. The custom is
          apparently intended to guard the knowledge of the real grave from
          demons, who might make an ill use of the body, if not of the soul,

          Dyaks of the Katoengouw river set up wooden images at their doors
          in the hope that the demons of the plague may be deluded into

          thus rids himself of the ghost. So if a man has been attacked by a
          crocodile and has contrived to escape, he makes a puppet of dough
          or meal and casts it into the water as a vicarious offering;
          otherwise the water-god, who is conceived in the shape of a
          crocodile, might be angry.<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279"

          certain of the western districts of Borneo if a man is taken
          suddenly and violently sick, the physician, who in this part of the
          world is generally an old woman, fashions a wooden image and brings
          it seven times into contact with the sufferer's head, while she
          says: <span class="tei tei-q">“This image serves to take the place
          of the sick man; sickness, pass over into the image.”</span> Then,
          with some rice, salt, and tobacco in a little basket, the
          substitute is carried to the spot where the evil spirit is supposed
          to have entered into the man. There it is set upright on the
          ground, after the physician has invoked the spirit as follows:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O devil, here is an image which stands
          instead of the sick man. Release the soul of the sick man and
          plague the image, for it is indeed prettier and better than
          he.”</span> Similar substitutes are used almost daily by these
          Dyaks for the purpose of drawing off evil influences from anybody's
          person. Thus, when an Ot Danom baby will not stop squalling, its
          maternal grandmother takes a large leaf, fashions it into a puppet
          to represent the child, and presses it against the infant's body.
          Having thus decanted the spirit, so to speak, from the baby into
          the puppet, she pierces the effigy with little arrows from a
          blow-gun, thereby killing the spirit that had vexed her
          child.<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href=

          Similarly in the island of Dama, between New Guinea and Celebes,
          where sickness is ascribed to the agency of demons, the doctor
          makes a doll of palm-leaf and lays it, together with some betel,
          rice, and half of an empty eggshell, on the patient's head. Lured
          by this bait the demon quits the sufferer's body and enters the
          palm-leaf doll, which the wily doctor thereupon promptly
          decapitates. This may <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg

          Dyak sorcerer, being called in to prescribe for a little boy who
          suffered from a disorder of the stomach, constructed two effigies
          of the boy and his mother out of bundles of clothes and offered
          them, together with some of the parents' finery, to the devil who
          was plaguing the child; it was hoped that the demon would take the
          effigies and leave the boy.<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282"

          magicians can conjure the demon of disease out of the patient's
          body into an image made out of a banana-tree with a human face and
          wrapt up in magic herbs; the image is then hurriedly removed and
          thrown away or buried beyond the boundaries of the village.<a id=

          Sometimes the image, dressed as a man or a woman according to the
          sex of the patient, is deposited at a cross-road or other
          thoroughfare, in the hope that some passer-by, seeing it, may start
          and cry out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! So-and-So is
          dead”</span>; for such an exclamation is supposed to delude the
          demon of disease into a belief that he has accomplished his fell

          well.<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href=

          and other evil influence from people. These effigies are kept in
          stock and sold in the shops which purvey counterfeit paper money
          and other spurious wares for the use of simple-minded ghosts and
          gods, who accept them in all good faith instead of the genuine
          articles. Nothing could well be cruder than the puppets that are
          employed to relieve sufferers from the many ills which flesh is
          heir to. They are composed of two bamboo splinters fastened
          together crosswise with a piece of paper pasted on one side to
          represent a human body. Two other shreds of paper, supposed to
          stand for boots, distinguish the effigy of a man from the effigy of
          a woman. Armed with one of these <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“substitutes for a person,”</span> as they are called,
          you may set fortune at defiance. If a member of your family, for
          example, is ailing, or has suffered any evil whatever, or even is
          merely threatened by misfortune, all that you have to do is to send
          for one of these puppets, pass it all over his body while you
          recite an appropriate spell, and then burn the puppet. The
          maleficent influence is thus elicited from the person of the
          sufferer and destroyed once for all. If your child has tumbled into
          one of those open sewers which yawn for the unwary in the streets,
          you need only fish him out, pass the puppet over his filthy little
          body, and say: <span class="tei tei-q">“This contact (of the
          substitute) with the front of the body brings purity and
          prosperity, and the contact with the back gives power to eat till

          ashes away. Moreover, the child's head should be shaven quite

          dressed in clothes and containing a number of the copper cash which
          form the currency of the country. Strictly speaking, there should
          be as many cash in the image as the person whom it represents has
          lived years; but the rule is not strictly observed. These images
          are placed on the path outside the house, and the poor people seize

          Ewe negroes of Togoland, in West Africa, think that the spirits of
          all living people come from heaven, where they live in the
          intervals between their incarnations. Life in Amedzowe, as they
          call that heavenly region, which lies a little to the east of the
          town of Ho, is very like life on earth. There are fields there and
          wildernesses and forests. Also there are all kinds of food, such as
          yams and maize and likewise stock-yams, not to speak of cotton; in
          fact, all these things came from heaven just as men themselves did.
          Moreover, everybody has his spiritual mother in heaven and his
          spiritual aunt, also his spiritual uncle, his spiritual
          grandfather, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg
          106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          so on, just as on earth. Now the spirits in heaven are apt to
          resent it when one of their number quits them to go and be born as
          a child on earth; and sometimes they will pursue the truant and
          carry him back to the celestial country, and that is what we call
          death. Little children are most commonly fetched away by their
          mother in heaven; for she wearies for them and comes and lays an
          invisible hand on the child, and it sickens and dies. If you hear a
          child whimpering of nights, you may be sure that its mother from
          heaven has laid her hand on it and is drawing it away to herself.
          If the child grows very sick and its earthly mother fears that it
          will die, she will mould two figures of clay, a man and a woman,
          and offer them in exchange to the heavenly mother, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O thou bearer and mother of children!
          instead of the child that has gone away from thee we bring thee
          here in exchange these clay men. Take them and withdraw thy hand
          from the child in this visible world.”</span> Grown-up people also,
          when they fall sick, will sometimes make images of clay and offer
          them as substitutes to the messengers who have come from heaven to
          fetch them away. These images are deposited with other offerings,
          such as cowry-shells and a musket, by the roadside; and if the
          messengers accept them instead of the sick man, he recovers.<a id=

          During an epidemic of small-pox the Ewe negroes will sometimes
          clear a space outside of the town, where they erect a number of low
          mounds and cover them with as many little clay figures as there are
          people in the place. Pots of food and water are also set out for
          the refreshment of the spirit of small-pox who, it is hoped, will
          take the clay figures and spare the living folk; and to make
          assurance doubly sure the road into the town is barricaded against
          him.<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href=

          death to somebody, he informs the person whose life is threatened,
          and together they concert measures to avert the evil omen. The man
          whose life is at stake has a small wooden figure called a
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">shigigiadsqu</span></span> made as like
          himself as the skill of the wood-carver will allow, and this he
          hangs round his neck by a string so that the figure lies exactly
          over his heart. In this position he wears it long enough to allow
          the heat of his body to be imparted to it, generally for about four
          days. On the fourth day the medicine-man comes to the house,
          arrayed in his bearskin and other insignia of office and bringing
          with him a wisp of teased bark and a toy canoe made of cedar-bark.
          Thus equipped, he sings a doleful ditty, the death-song of the
          tribe. Then he washes the man over the region of the heart with the
          wisp of bark dipped in water, places the wisp, together with the
          wooden image, in the canoe, and after again singing the
          death-chant, commits image, wisp, and canoe to the flames, where
          they are all consumed. The death-chant is now changed to a song of
          joy, and the man who was lately in fear of his life joins in. He
          may well be gay, for has he not given death the slip by devoting to
          destruction, not merely a wisp saturated with the dangerous
          defilement of his body, but also a substitute made in his own

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With these
          examples before us we may fairly conclude that the woollen
          effigies, which at the festival of the Compitalia might be seen
          hanging at the doors of all the houses in ancient Rome, were not
          substitutes for human victims who had formerly been sacrificed at
          this season, but rather vicarious offerings presented to the Mother
          or Grandmother of Ghosts, in the hope that on her rounds through
          the city she would accept or mistake the effigies for the inmates
          of the house and so spare the living for another year. It is
          possible that the puppets made of rushes, which in the month of May
          the pontiffs and Vestal Virgins annually threw into the Tiber from

          same significance; that is, they may have been designed to purge
          the city from demoniac influence by diverting the attention of the
          demons from human beings to the puppets and then toppling the whole
          uncanny crew, neck and crop, into the river, which would soon sweep
          them far out to sea. In precisely the same way the natives of Old
          Calabar used periodically to rid their town of the devils which
          infested it by luring the unwary demons into a number of lamentable
          scarecrows, which they afterwards flung into the river.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a> This
          interpretation of the Roman custom is supported to some extent by
          the evidence of Plutarch, who speaks of the ceremony as

          However, other explanations of the rite have been proposed: indeed
          these puppets of rushes have been a standing puzzle to Roman
          antiquaries in ancient and modern times.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
        chapter we saw that primitive peoples often partake of the new corn
        and the new fruits sacramentally, because they suppose them to be
        instinct with a divine spirit or life. At a later age, when the
        fruits of the earth are conceived as created rather than as animated
        by a divinity, the new fruits are no longer partaken of sacramentally
        as the body and blood of a god; but a portion of them is offered to
        the divine beings who are believed to have produced them. Originally,
        perhaps, offerings of first-fruits were supposed to be necessary for
        the subsistence of the divinities, who without them must have died of
        hunger;<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href=
        "#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> but in
        after times they seem to be looked on rather in the light of a
        tribute or mark of homage rendered by man to the gods for the good
        gifts they have bestowed on him. Sometimes the first-fruits are
        presented to the king, perhaps in his character of a god; very often
        they are made over to the spirits of the human dead, who are
        sometimes thought to have it in their power to give or withhold the
        crops. Till the first-fruits have been offered to the deity, the
        dead, or the king, people are not at liberty to eat of the new crops.
        But, as it is not always possible to draw a sharp line between the
        sacrament and the sacrifice of first-fruits, it may be well to round
        off this part of the subject by giving some examples of the
        latter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ovambo or

        withhold rain, a matter of vital importance in the parched region of

        people pay great respect to the spirits of the departed, and they
        hold a thanksgiving festival in their honour at the close of the
        harvest. When the new corn has been reaped and ground, a portion of
        it is made into porridge and carried to the quarters of the principal
        wife. Here all the inhabitants of the kraal assemble; the head of the
        family takes some of the porridge, dips it in melted fat, and throws
        it to the east, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Take it, ye spirits

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Take it, ye spirits of the West!”</span>
        This is regarded as a thank-offering presented to the spirits of the

        must be performed. The persons to whom the corn belongs bring a new
        vessel to the spot, in which they boil some of the grain. When it is
        boiled they throw a few handfuls of it on the heap of corn, saying,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you, gods; give us bread to-morrow

        the sacrifice of the first-fruits to the gods is the prominent idea,

        the Basutos retain a lively sense of the sanctity of the corn in
        itself; for, so long as it is exposed to view, all defiled persons
        are carefully kept from it. If it is necessary to employ a defiled
        person in carrying home the harvest, he remains at some distance
        while the sacks are being filled, and only approaches to place them

        the Winamwanga, a tribe of north-eastern Rhodesia, between Lake
        Nyassa and Lake Tanganyika, it is customary to offer the first beer
        and the first flour made from the new harvest of millet to the
        spirits of the dead. The head of the family pours out some beer and a
        small quantity of the new flour in a heap on the floor of his own
        house, after which he prays to the spirits of his forefathers, thanks
        them for the harvest, and invites them to come and partake of it with
        the family. The priest performs the same ceremony at the shrine for
        the whole village. The householder or the priest speaks to the
        spirits as if they were sitting around him. Thus he may say,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“O ye great spirits, fathers in the spirit
        world, mothers in the spirit world, and all ye others, bless us now.
        Here is the food, and here is the offering, call ye all of you each
        other.”</span> Then after summoning the dead by their names he may go
        on: <span class="tei tei-q">“Come all of you and partake of this
        offering. Ye great spirits, all things of this earth were known to
        you while yet ye were here. Take care of this your family, and of all
        these your children. May we ever go in our ways in prosperity. Oh! ye
        great spirits, give to us food and all the produce of the land. Drive
        ye away all illnesses from your family, ye great spirits; every evil
        spirit put far away from us, and whatever might seek to hurt us may
        it fly away on the wind. Cause ye us to abide in peace.”</span><a id=

        fastness which in former days his forefathers held against the
        marauding Angoni. Here the grandfather of the present chief lies
        buried. Before his tomb a bull is slain, and pots of freshly-brewed
        beer and porridge made from the first-fruits are deposited before the
        shrine. The ground is then carefully cleaned of weeds, and the blood
        of the bull is sprinkled on the freshly-turned-up soil and on the
        rafters of the little hut. After offering the customary prayers in
        thanksgiving for the harvest, and beseeching the spirits to partake
        with them of the first-fruits, the procession retires. On their
        return to the village, the carcase of the bull is divided, all

        the millet is ripe, the Nubas of Jebel-Nuba, a range of mountains in
        the eastern Sudan, observe the following ceremony. Every group of
        villages is presided over by a sacred pontiff called a <span class=

        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        under the inspiration of a spirit named Laro. So when it is known
        that the grain is ready to be cut, a drum is beaten, the pontiff
        mounts his horse and, attended by all the elderly men and women,
        repairs to his fields, while the rest of the people betake themselves
        to their own farms. There the people whose eldest child is a boy
        break five ears of corn, and those whose eldest child is a girl break
        four. But young unmarried people break five or four ears according as
        they desire to have a boy or a girl for their first-born. All then
        return to the village and place the ears they have gathered on the
        hedge which serves as an enclosure. When the beat of the drum and
        multitudinous cries of joy announce the return of the pontiff, the
        people take the gathered ears and advance to meet him. He rides at
        the head of a cavalcade composed of all the men who have horses.
        After that, attended by the elders, he retires to his house, while
        the rest of the people deposit the ears of corn in the cave of Laro,
        the being who inspires the holy pontiff. Feasting, drinking, and
        horse-races conclude the ceremony. At the races the young folk amuse
        themselves by flinging stalks of millet before the horses to make
        them shy and throw their riders.<a id="noteref_317" name=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> to the gods at the beginning of harvest,
        generally at the new or the full moon. There were two harvests in the
        year; the barley was reaped in spring and the rice in autumn. From
        the new grain, whether barley or rice, a sacrificial cake was
        prepared and set forth on twelve potsherds for the two great gods
        Indra and Agni; a pap or gruel of boiled grain, sodden either in
        water or milk, was offered to the Visve Devah, that is, to the common
        mob of deities; and a cake on one potsherd was presented to Heaven
        and Earth. The origin of these sacrifices of first-fruits was
        explained by the following myth. They say that the gods and their
        powerful rivals the Asuras once strove with each other for the
        mastery. In this strife the Asuras defiled, both by magic and by
        poison, the plants on which men and beasts subsist; for thus they
        hoped to get the better of the gods. Therefore neither man nor beast
        could eat food, and for lack of it they well nigh perished. When the
        gods heard of it, they said one to the other, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come let us rid the plants of the defilement,”</span>
        and they did so by means of the sacrifice. But they could not agree
        as to which of them should receive the sacrifices, so to decide this
        delicate question they ran a race, and Indra and Agni came in first;
        that is why the cake is offered to them on twelve potsherds, while
        the common mob of the gods have to put up with a simple pap or gruel.
        To this day, therefore, he who offers the first-fruits to the gods
        does it either because no one will then be able to defile the plants,
        neither by magic nor yet by poison; or perhaps he does it because the
        gods did so before him. Be that as it may, certain it is that he
        thereby renders both kinds of plants wholesome and innocuous, both
        the plants which men eat and the plants on which cattle graze; that
        indeed is the reason why the sacrificer sacrifices the first-fruits.
        And the priest's fee for the sacrifice is the first-born calf of the
        season, which is, as it were, the first-fruit of the cattle.<a id=

        the Thay of Indo-China the first-fruits of the rice are offered at
        harvest to the guardian spirit of the family before the household may
        partake of the new crop. The guardian spirit of the family is the
        last ancestor who died; he mounts guard until he is relieved by his
        successor; his shrine is a corner of the house screened off by a low
        trellis of bamboo. But besides the first-fruits offered him at
        harvest this guardian spirit receives some of the parched grain in
        spring, at the time when the first thunder of the season is heard to
        mutter. The grain which is presented to him on this occasion was
        plucked from the crop before the rice was quite ripe, and it has been
        carefully kept to be offered to him when the first peal of thunder in
        spring announces the reviving energies of nature. When all is ready,
        the rice is served up together with fish, which have been caught for
        the purpose, on a table set in the corner which is sacred to the
        guardian spirit. A priest drones out a long invitation to the spirit
        to come and feast with his children; then the family sits down to
        table and consumes the offerings. At the close of the banquet the
        daughter-in-law of the deceased ancestor hangs up a basket containing

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Bukaua of
        German New Guinea think that the spirits of their dead have power to
        make the fruits of the earth to grow. Accordingly when they have
        cleared a patch in the forest for cultivation and are planting their
        crops, they take particular care to plant slips near the tree-stumps
        which have been left standing in the field, because the spirits of
        their long dead ancestors are supposed to perch on them. While they
        plant, they call out the names of the dead, praying them to guard the
        field, so that their children, the living, may have food to eat and
        not suffer hunger. And similarly, when they plant stones shaped like
        taro bulbs in the ground, which are supposed to produce a fine crop
        of taro, they pray to their forefathers to grant them an abundance of
        the fruits. When the crops are ripe, the people fetch bundles of
        taro, clusters of bananas, sugar-canes, and vegetables from the
        fields and bring them back solemnly to the village; a feast is
        prepared and a portion of the new fruits, along with tobacco, betel,
        and dog's flesh, is put in a coco-nut shell and set on a scaffold in
        the house of the owner of the field, while he prays to the spirits of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125"
        id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his forefathers, saying,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye who have guarded our field as we asked
        you to do, there is something for you; now look on us favourably also
        for the time to come.”</span> Afterwards, while the people are
        feasting, the owner privily stirs the contents of the coco-nut shell
        with his finger, and then calls the attention of the others to it as
        a proof that the spirits have partaken of the offering provided for
        them. Finally the food remaining in the shell is consumed by the
        banqueters.<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In certain tribes
        of Fiji <span class="tei tei-q">“the first-fruits of the yam harvest
        are presented to the ancestors in the Nanga [sacred enclosure] with
        great ceremony before the bulk of the crop is dug for the people's
        use, and no man may taste of the new yams until the presentation has
        been made. The yams thus offered are piled in the Great Nanga, and
        are allowed to rot there. If any one were impiously bold enough to
        appropriate them to his own use, he would be smitten with madness.
        The mission teacher before mentioned told me that, when he visited
        the Nanga he saw among the weeds with which it was overgrown,
        numerous yam vines which had sprung up out of the piles of decayed
        offerings. Great feasts are made at the presentations of the
        first-fruits, which are times of public rejoicing, and the Nanga
        itself is frequently spoken of as the <span class=

        other parts of Fiji the practice with regard to the first-fruits
        seems to have been different, for we are told by another observer
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“the first-fruits of the yams, which are
        always presented at the principal temple of the district, become the
        property of the priests, and form their revenue, although the
        pretence of their being required for the use of the god is generally
        kept up.”</span><a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href=

        Tana, one of the New Hebrides, the general name for gods appeared to
        be <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">aremha</span></span>, which meant <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a dead man.”</span> The spirits of departed ancestors
        were among the gods of the people. Chiefs who reached an advanced age
        were deified after their death, addressed by name, and prayed to on
        various occasions. They were supposed to preside especially over the
        growth of the yams and fruit-trees. The first-fruits <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were presented to them. A little of the
        new fruit was laid on a stone, or on a shelving branch of the tree,
        or on a rude temporary altar, made of a few sticks lashed together
        with strips of bark, in the form of a table, with its four feet stuck
        in the ground. All being quiet, the chief acted as high priest, and
        prayed aloud as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Compassionate
        father! here is some food for you; eat it; be kind to us on account
        of it.”</span> Then all the people shouted. This took place about
        noon, and afterwards the assembled people feasted and danced till

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Florida, one of
        the Solomon Islands, the canarium nut is much used in the native
        cookery, but formerly none might be eaten till the sacrifice of the
        first-fruits had been offered to the ghosts of the dead. This was
        done on behalf of a whole village by a man who inherited a knowledge
        of the way in which the sacrifice should be offered, and who
        accordingly had authority to open the season. When he saw that the
        time had come, he raised a shout early in the morning, then climbed a
        tree, cracked the nuts, ate some himself, and put some on the stones
        in his sacred place for the particular ghost whom he worshipped. Then
        all the people might gather the nuts for themselves. The chief
        offered food, in which the new nuts were mixed, on the stones of the
        village sanctuary; and every man who revered a ghost of his own did
        the same in his private sanctuary.<a id="noteref_362" name=
        "noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a> This
        sacrifice of first-fruits was witnessed by Mr. Woodford at the
        village of Aola, in the neighbouring island of Guadalcanar. The
        canarium nuts, or Solomon Island almonds, had been ripe for a week,
        and Mr. Woodford had expressed a wish to taste them, but he was told
        that this was quite impossible till the offering to the ghost had
        been made. As a native put it, <span class="tei tei-q">“Devil he eat
        first; all man he eat behind.”</span> All the inhabitants of the
        village adjourned to the sea-shore in groups of ten or twelve to
        perform the sacrifice. The party to which Mr. Woodford attached
        himself swept a space clean beneath the spreading branches of a
        Barringtonia, and there constructed half-a-dozen tiny altars, each
        about six inches square, out of dry sticks. On these altars they laid
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127"
        id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> offerings of yams, taros,
        bananas, and a little flesh; and a few of the nuts were skinned and
        set up on sticks round about the altars. Fire was then made by the
        friction of wood, for matches might not be used for this purpose,
        though probably every man had a box of them in his bag. With the
        sacred flame thus produced the altars were kindled and the offerings
        consumed. When this was done, the women produced large flat cakes
        baked of a paste of pounded nuts, and these were eaten by all.<a id=
        "noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="#note_363"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a> In Saa,
        another of the Solomon Islands, when the yams are ripe, the people
        fetch some from each garden to offer to the ghosts. Early in the
        morning all the male members of a family assemble at the sanctuary of
        the particular ancestral ghosts whom they revere. One of them goes
        with a yam into the holy place and cries with a loud voice to the
        ghosts, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is yours to eat,”</span> and
        with that he sets the yam beside the skull which is in the sanctuary.
        The others call quietly upon all the ancestors and present their
        yams, which are many in number, because one from each garden is given
        to each of the ghosts. Moreover, if any man has a relic of the dead
        at home, such as a head, or bones, or hair, he takes back a yam to
        his house and places it beside the head or whatever it may be. In the
        same island, as in Florida, the new canarium nuts may not be eaten
        until the first-fruits have been offered to the ghosts. Moreover, the
        first flying-fish of the season must be sacrificed to these spirits
        of the dead before the living are allowed to partake of the fish. The
        ghosts to whom the flying-fish are offered have the form of sharks.
        Some of them have sanctuaries ashore, where images of sharks are set
        up; and the flying-fish are laid before these images. Other
        shark-ghosts have no place on shore; so the fish offered to them are
        taken out to sea and shredded into the water, while the names of the
        ghosts are called out.<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some of the
        Kingsmill Islands the god most commonly worshipped was called
        Tubuériki. He was represented by a flat coral stone, of irregular
        shape, about three feet <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg
        128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        long by eighteen inches wide, set up on end in the open air. Leaves
        of the coco-nut palm were tied about it, considerably increasing its
        size and height. The leaves were changed every month, that they might
        be always fresh. The worship paid to the god consisted in repeating
        prayers before the stone, and laying beside it a portion of the food
        prepared by the people for their own use. This they did at their
        daily meals, at festivals, and whenever they specially wished to
        propitiate the deity. The first-fruits of the season were always
        offered to him. Every family of distinction had one of these stones
        which was considered rather in the light of a family altar than as an
        idol.<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Tonga
        Islands the first-fruits of the year were offered with solemn
        ceremony to the sacred chief Tooitonga, who was regarded as divine.
        The ceremony generally took place about October, and the people
        believed that if the rite were neglected the vengeance of the gods
        would fall in a signal manner upon them. The following is a
        description of the festival as it was celebrated in the days when a
        European flag rarely floated among the islands of the Pacific:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Inachi.</span></span> This word means,
        literally, a share or portion of anything that is to be or has been
        distributed out: but in the sense here mentioned it means that
        portion of the fruits of the earth, and other eatables, which is
        offered to the gods in the person of the divine chief Tooitonga,
        which allotment is made once a year, just before the yams in general
        are arrived at a state of maturity; those which are used in this
        ceremony being of a kind which admit of being planted sooner than
        others, and, consequently, they are the first fruits of the yam
        season. The object of this offering is to insure the protection of
        the gods, that their favour may be extended to the welfare of the
        nation generally, and in particular to the productions of the earth,
        of which yams are the most important.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The time for planting most kinds of yams is about the
        latter end of July, but the species called <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">caho-caho</span></span>, which is always used in
        this ceremony, is put in the ground about a month before, when, on
        each plantation, there is a small <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> piece of land chosen and fenced in, for the
        purpose of growing a couple of yams of the above description. As soon
        as they have arrived at a state of maturity, the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">How</span></span>
        [the King] sends a messenger to Tooitonga, stating that the yams for
        the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">inachi</span></span> are fit to be taken up, and
        requesting that he would appoint a day for the ceremony: he generally
        fixes on the tenth day afterwards, reckoning the following day for
        the first. There are no particular preparations made till the day
        before the ceremony: at night, however, the sound of the conch is
        heard occasionally in different parts of the islands, and as the day
        of the ceremony approaches it becomes more frequent, so that the
        people of almost every plantation sound the conch three or four
        times, which, breaking in upon the silence of the night, has a
        pleasing effect, particularly at Vavaoo, where the number of woods
        and hills send back repeated echoes, adding greatly to the effect.
        The day before the ceremony, the yams are dug up, and ornamented with
        a kind of ribbons prepared from the inner membrane of the leaf of a
        species of pandanus, and dyed red; when thus prepared, it is called
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mellecoola</span></span> and is wrapped round
        the yam, beginning at one end, and running round spirally to the
        other, when it is brought back in the opposite direction, the turns
        crossing each other in a very neat manner. As the ceremony is always
        performed at the island where Tooitonga chooses to reside, the
        distant islands must make these preparations two or three days
        beforehand, that the yams, etc., may be sent in time to Vavaoo, where
        we will suppose the affair is to take place. The ninth day then is
        employed in preparing and collecting the yams and other provisions,
        such as fish, cava root, and <span class=

        out in the public roads till about eight o'clock, when the people
        from all quarters of the island are seen advancing towards the Mooa,
        and canoes from all the other islands are landing their men; so that
        all the inhabitants of Tonga seem approaching by sea and land,

        yams being all slung, each pole is carried by two men upon their
        shoulders, one walking before the other, and the yam hanging between

        towards the grave of the last Tooitonga (which is generally in the

        advancing in a single line, every two bearing a yam, with a slow and
        measured pace, sinking at every step, as if their burden were of
        immense weight. In the meantime the chiefs and matabooles are seated
        in a semicircle before the grave, with their heads bowed down, and
        their hands clasped before them.”</span> The procession then marched
        round the grave twice or thrice in a great circle, the conchs blowing
        and the men singing. Next the yams, still suspended from the poles,
        were deposited <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg
        131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        before the grave, and their bearers sat down beside them. One of the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">matabooles</span></span> of Tooitonga, seating
        himself before the grave, a little in advance of the men, now
        addressed the gods generally, and afterwards particularly, mentioning
        the late Tooitonga, and the names of several others. He thanked them
        for their divine bounty in favouring the land with the prospect of so
        good a harvest, and prayed that their beneficence might be continued
        in future. When he had finished, the men rose and resumed their
        loads, and after parading two or three times before the grave,
        marched back to the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">malái</span></span> the same way they came,
        singing and blowing the conchs as before. The chiefs and <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">matabooles</span></span> soon followed to the
        same place, where the yams had been again deposited and loosened from
        the poles, though they still retained their ornaments. Here the
        company sat down in a great circle, presided over by Tooitonga, while
        the king and other great chiefs retired into the background among the
        mass of the people. Then the other articles that formed part of the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">inachi</span></span> were brought forward,
        consisting of dried fish, mats, etc., which, with the yams, were
        divided into shares by one of the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">matabooles</span></span> of Tooitonga. About a
        fourth was allotted to the gods, and appropriated by the priests;
        about a half fell to the king; and the remainder belonged to
        Tooitonga. The materials of the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">inachi</span></span> having been carried away,
        the company set themselves to drink <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cava</span></span>. Some <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">cava</span></span>
        root was brought and prepared; a large quantity of provisions,
        perhaps a hundred and fifty baskets-full, was set forth, and a small
        part of it was distributed to be eaten with the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cava</span></span>. While the infusion was
        preparing, a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mataboole</span></span> made a speech to the
        people, saying that, as they had performed this important ceremony,
        the gods would protect them and grant them long lives, if only they
        continued to observe the religious rites and to pay due respect to
        the chiefs. When the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cava</span></span> was all drunk, the circle
        separated, and the provisions were shared out to each chief according
        to his rank. The day concluded with wrestling, boxing, and so forth,
        and then the night dances began. When these were ended, the people
        went home perfectly assured of the protection of the gods. At this
        ceremony, we are informed, the quantity <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        the first-fruits are paid to the chief, it is rather in his religious
        than in his civil capacity that he receives them. It is true that the
        king of Tonga received a large share of the first-fruits, indeed a
        larger share than was allotted to the divine chief; but it is very
        noticeable that while the division of the first-fruits was taking
        place under the presidency of the divine chief, the king and the
        other great chiefs retired from the scene and mingled with the mass
        of the people, as if to indicate that as mere laymen they had no

        minced up with the carcase of a dog in the presence of the old men,
        who alone were privileged to assist at this solemn rite. Then, after
        performing certain ceremonies, the old men began to dance, and some
        young girls, wound up to a pitch of frenzy, threw themselves on the
        offering and bolted it in an instant. Thereupon the old men seized
        the damsels and ducked them in the river Arkansas, which had a

        Lower Mississippi, was the Harvest Festival or the Festival of New
        Fire. An early account of this ceremony has been already submitted to
        the reader,<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href=
        "#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a> but it
        may not be amiss to add here for comparison the later description by
        Chateaubriand, which differs from the other in some particulars, and
        lays stress on the sacrifice rather than on the sacrament of
        first-fruits. According to Chateaubriand, then, when the time for the
        festival drew near, a crier went through the villages calling upon
        the people to prepare new vessels and new garments, to wash their
        houses, and to burn the old grain, the old garments, and the old
        utensils in a common fire. He also proclaimed an amnesty to
        criminals. Next day he appeared again, commanding the people to fast
        for three days, to abstain from all pleasures, and to make use of the
        medicine of purification. Thereupon all the people took some drops
        extracted from a root which they called the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“root of blood.”</span> It was a kind of plantain and
        distilled a red liquor which acted as a violent emetic. During their
        three days' fast the people kept silence. At the end of it the crier
        proclaimed that the festival would begin on the following day. So
        next morning, as soon as it began to grow light in the sky, the
        people streamed from all quarters towards the temple of the Sun. The
        temple was a large building with two doors, one opening to the east,
        the other to the west. On this morning the eastern door of the temple
        stood open. Facing the eastern door was an altar, placed so as to
        catch the first beams of the rising sun. An image of a <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chouchouacha</span></span> (a small marsupial)
        stood upon the altar; on its right was an image of a rattlesnake, on
        its left an image of a marmoset. Before these images a fire of
        oak-bark burned perpetually. Once a year only, on the eve of the
        Harvest Festival, was the sacred flame suffered to die out. To the
        right of the altar, on the morning of this holy day, stood the great
        chief, who took his title and traced his descent from the Sun. To the
        left of the altar stood his wife. Round them were grouped, according
        to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name=
        "Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> their ranks, the war
        chiefs, the sachems, the heralds, and the young braves. In front of
        the altar were piled bundles of dry reeds, stacked in concentric
        rings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The high priest,
        standing on the threshold of the temple, kept his eyes fixed on the
        eastern horizon. Before presiding at the festival he had to plunge
        thrice into the Mississippi. In his hands he held two pieces of dry
        wood which he kept rubbing slowly against each other, muttering magic
        words. At his side two acolytes held two cups filled with a kind of
        black sherbet. All the women, their backs turned to the east, each
        leaning with one hand on her rude mattock and supporting her infant
        with the other, stood in a great semicircle at the gate of the
        temple. Profound silence reigned throughout the multitude while the
        priest watched attentively the growing light in the east. As soon as
        the diffused light of dawn began to be shot with beams of fire, he
        quickened the motion of the two pieces of wood which he held in his
        hands; and at the moment when the upper edge of the sun's disc
        appeared above the horizon, fire flashed from the wood and was caught
        in tinder. At the same instant the women outside the temple faced
        round and held up their infants and their mattocks to the rising
        sun.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great chief
        and his wife now drank the black liquor. The priests kindled the
        circle of dried reeds; fire was set to the heap of oak-bark on the
        altar, and from this sacred flame all the hearths of the village were
        rekindled. No sooner were the circles of reeds consumed than the
        chief's wife came from the temple and placing herself at the head of
        the women marched in procession to the harvest-fields, whither the
        men were not allowed to follow them. They went to gather the first
        sheaves of maize, and returned to the temple bearing them on their
        heads. Some of the sheaves they presented to the high priest, who
        laid them on the altar. Others they used to bake the unleavened bread
        which was to be eaten in the evening. The eastern door of the
        sanctuary was now closed, and the western door was opened.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When day began to
        decline, the multitude assembled once more at the temple, this time
        at its western gate, where they formed a great crescent, with the
        horns turned towards <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The practice of
        killing a god has now been traced amongst peoples who have reached
        the agricultural stage of society. We have seen that the spirit of
        the corn, or of other cultivated plants, is commonly represented
        either in human or in animal form, and that in some places a custom
        has prevailed of killing annually either the human or the animal
        representative of the god. One reason for thus killing the
        corn-spirit in the person of his representative has been given
        implicitly in an earlier part of this work: we may suppose that the
        intention was to guard him or her (for the corn-spirit is often
        feminine) from the enfeeblement of old age by transferring the
        spirit, while still hale and hearty, to the person of a youthful and
        vigorous successor. Apart from the desirability of renewing his
        divine energies, the death of the corn-spirit may have been deemed
        inevitable under the sickles or the knives of the reapers, and his
        worshippers may accordingly have felt bound to acquiesce in the sad
        necessity.<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href=
        "#note_387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> But,
        further, we have found a widespread custom of eating the god
        sacramentally, either in the shape of the man or animal who
        represents the god, or in the shape of bread made in human or animal
        form. The reasons for thus partaking of the body of the god are, from
        the primitive standpoint, simple enough. The savage commonly believes
        that by eating the flesh of an animal or man he acquires not only the
        physical, but even the moral and intellectual qualities which were
        characteristic of that animal or man; so when the creature is deemed
        divine, our simple savage naturally expects to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> absorb a portion of its divinity along
        with its material substance. It may be well to illustrate by
        instances this common faith in the acquisition of virtues or vices of
        many kinds through the medium of animal food, even when there is no
        pretence that the viands consist of the body or blood of a god. The
        doctrine forms part of the widely ramified system of sympathetic or
        homoeopathic magic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, for example,
        the Creeks, Cherokee, and kindred tribes of North American Indians
        <span class="tei tei-q">“believe that nature is possest of such a
        property, as to transfuse into men and animals the qualities, either
        of the food they use, or of those objects that are presented to their
        senses; he who feeds on venison is, according to their physical
        system, swifter and more sagacious than the man who lives on the
        flesh of the clumsy bear, or helpless dunghill fowls, the slow-footed
        tame cattle, or the heavy wallowing swine. This is the reason that
        several of their old men recommend, and say, that formerly their
        greatest chieftains observed a constant rule in their diet, and
        seldom ate of any animal of a gross quality, or heavy motion of body,
        fancying it conveyed a dullness through the whole system, and

        thus fear to eat the flesh of slow-footed animals lest they should
        themselves become slow-footed, the Bushmen of South Africa purposely
        ate the flesh of such creatures, and the reason which they gave for
        doing so exhibits a curious refinement of savage philosophy. They
        imagined that the game which they pursued would be influenced
        sympathetically by the food in the body of the <span class=

        and kill it. For that reason hunters of gemsbok particularly avoided
        eating the flesh of the swift and agile springbok; indeed they would
        not even touch it with their hands, because they believed the
        springbok to be a very lively creature which did not go to sleep at

        swallowing the maggots bred in the putrid carcase of the animal of

        the occasion of a calamity, while the women are giving themselves up

        boa constrictor or a crocodile, another howling and leaping like a

        they often call a person with a bad memory an <span class=

        that <span class="tei tei-q">“the otter's head must not lightly be
        used as an article of food, for unless people are very careful they
        will, if they eat it, become as forgetful as that creature. And hence
        it happens that when an otter has been killed the people do not
        usually eat the head. But if they are seized with a very strong
        desire for a feast of otter's head, they may partake thereof,
        providing proper precautions are taken. When eating it the people
        must take their swords, knives, axes, bows and arrows, tobacco-boxes
        and pipes, trays, cups, garden tools, and everything they possess,
        tie them up in bundles with carrying slings, and sit with them
        attached to their heads while in the act of eating. This feast may be
        partaken of in this way, and no other. If this method be carefully
        adhered to, there will be no danger of forgetting where a thing has
        been placed, otherwise loss of memory will be the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Strange as it may
        seem to us, one motive which induces a savage warrior to eat the
        flesh or drink the blood of the foe whom he has slain appears to be a
        wish to form an indissoluble covenant of friendship and brotherhood
        with his victim. For it is a widespread belief among savages that by
        transfusing a little of their blood into each other's bodies two men
        become kinsmen and allies; the same blood now circulating in the
        veins of both, neither can injure the other without at the same time
        injuring himself; the two have therefore given each other the
        strongest bond, the best possible hostages, for their good
        behaviour.<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href=

        on this theory, the primitive warrior seeks to convert his slain foe
        into the firmest of friends by imbibing the dead man's blood or
        swallowing his flesh. That at all events appears to be the idea at
        the root of the following customs. When an Arawak Indian of British
        Guiana has murdered another, he repairs on the third night to the
        grave of his victim, and pressing a pointed stick through the corpse
        he licks off and swallows any blood that he finds adhering to the
        stick. For he believes that if he did not taste his victim's blood,
        he would go mad and die; whereas by swallowing the blood he averts
        any ill consequences that might flow to him from the <span class=

        been slain by a Nandi, the blood must be carefully washed off the
        spear or sword into a cup made of grass, and drunk by the slayer. If
        this is not done it is thought that the man will become

        among the tribes of the Lower Niger <span class="tei tei-q">“it is
        customary and necessary for the executioner to lick the blood that is
        on the blade”</span>; moreover, <span class="tei tei-q">“the custom
        of licking the blood off the blade of a sword by which a man has been
        killed in war is common to all these tribes, and the explanation
        given me by the Ibo, which is generally accepted, is, that if this
        was not done, the act of killing would so affect the strikers as to
        cause them to run amok among their own people; because the sight and
        smell of blood render them absolutely senseless as well as regardless

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most probable
        explanation of these practices seems to be that a manslayer is
        thought to be driven mad by the ghost of his victim, who takes
        possession of his murderer's body and causes him to demean himself in
        a frantic manner; whereas, as soon as the slayer has tasted the blood
        of the slain, he becomes a blood-brother of his victim, whose ghost
        accordingly will do him no harm.<a id="noteref_485" name=

        id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a similar custom formerly
        observed by the Maoris. When a warrior had slain his foe in combat,
        he tasted his blood, believing that this preserved him from the
        avenging spirit of his victim; for they imagined that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the moment a slayer had tasted the blood of the slain,
        the dead man became a part of his being and placed him under the
        protection of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        light of these facts we can now explain the opinion, still widely
        held in Calabria, that if a murderer is to escape, he must suck his
        victim's blood from the reeking blade of the dagger with which he did
        the deed;<a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href=
        "#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a> and,
        further, we can see at least a glimmering of reason, however
        misapplied, in the confidence cherished by the Botocudos of Brazil,
        that if only they ate a morsel of the flesh of their enemies, the
        arrows of the fellow tribesmen of the slain would not be able to hit
        them.<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href=
        "#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> Indeed
        the evidence which I have just adduced suggests that the intention of
        forming a blood-covenant with the dead may have been a common motive
        for the cannibalism which has been so often practised by savage
        victors on the bodies of their victims.<a id="noteref_489" name=

        was so, it would to some extent mitigate the horror with which such a
        practice is naturally viewed by civilised observers; since it would
        reveal the cannibal feast, no longer in the lurid light of a brutal
        outburst of blind rage and hatred against the vanquished, but in the
        milder aspect of a solemn rite designed to wipe out the memory of
        past hostilities and to establish a permanent relation of friendship
        and good fellowship with the dead.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another mode of
        entering into communion with the dead by means of their bodily relics
        is to grind their bones to powder or to burn them to ashes, and then
        to swallow the powder or the ashes mixed with food or drink. This
        method of absorbing the virtues or appropriating the souls
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157"
        id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of deceased kinsfolk has been
        practised by a number of Indian tribes of South America. Thus the
        Tarianas, Tucanos, and other tribes in the valley of the Amazon,
        about a month after the funeral, disinter the corpse, which is then
        much decomposed, and put it in a great pan or oven over the fire till
        all the volatile parts are driven off with a most horrible stench,
        leaving only a black carbonaceous paste. This paste is then pounded
        into a fine powder, and being mixed in several large vats of the
        native beer, the liquor is drunk by the assembled company until all
        is consumed. They believe that thus the virtues of the deceased are
        transmitted to the drinkers.<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490"
        href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Similarly among the Xomanas and Passes of the Rio Negro and Japura
        River in Brazil, it was customary to burn the bones of the dead and
        mingle the ashes in their drink; <span class="tei tei-q">“for they
        fancied, that by this means they received into their own bodies the

        suppose that a similar motive underlies the custom wherever it has
        been observed by the Indians of South America, even when this
        particular motive is not expressly alleged by our authorities. For
        example, the Retoroños, Pechuyos, and Guarayos of eastern Bolivia
        <span class="tei tei-q">“manifested their feeling for the dead by a
        remarkable custom: when the body had mouldered they dug up the bones,
        reduced them to powder, and mingling it with maize, composed a sort
        of cake, which they considered it the strongest mark of friendship to
        offer and partake. Some of the first missionaries were regaled with
        this family bread, before they knew what they were

        of magic powder which has been carefully compounded of the ashes of
        certain plants and animals. The plants and animals whose ashes

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the Zulus
        know how to inoculate themselves not merely with moral virtue, but
        even with celestial power. For you must know that the Zulus have
        heaven-herds or sky-herds, who drive away clouds big with hail and
        lightning, just as herdsmen drive cattle before them. These
        heaven-herds are in sympathy with the heaven. For when the heaven is
        about to be darkened, and before the clouds appear or the thunder
        mutters, the heart of the heaven-herd feels it coming, for it is hot
        within him and he is excited by anger. When the sky begins to be
        overcast, he too grows dark like it; when it thunders, he frowns,
        that his face may be black as the scowl of the angry heaven. Now the
        way in which he thus becomes sympathetic with all the changing moods
        of the inconstant heaven is this: he eats the heaven and scarifies
        himself with it. And the way <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> in which he eats the heaven and scarifies
        himself with it is as follows. When a bullock is struck by lightning,
        the wizard takes its flesh and puts it in a sherd and eats it while
        it is hot, mixed with medicine; and thus he eats the heaven by eating
        the flesh, which came from the beast, which was struck by the
        lightning, which came down from the heaven. And in like manner he
        scarifies himself with the heaven, for he makes cuts in his body and
        rubs in medicine mixed with the flesh of a bullock that was struck by
        lightning.<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href=

        Caffre tribes, when an animal or a man has been struck by lightning,
        the priest comes straightway and vaccinates every person in the
        kraal, apparently as a sort of insurance against lightning. He sets
        to work by tying a number of charms round the neck of every man and
        woman in the village, in order that they may have power to dig the
        dead man's grave; for in these tribes beasts and men alike that have
        been struck by lightning are always buried, and the flesh is never
        eaten. Next a sacrificial beast is killed and a fire kindled, in
        which certain magic woods or roots are burned to charcoal, and then
        ground to powder. The priest thereupon makes incisions in various
        parts of the bodies of each inmate of the kraal, and rubs a portion
        of the powdered charcoal into the cuts; the rest of the powder he
        mixes with sour milk, and gives to them all to drink. From the time
        the lightning strikes the kraal until this ceremony has been
        performed, the people are obliged to abstain entirely from the use of
        milk. Their heads are then shaved. Should a house have been struck by
        lightning it must be abandoned, with everything in it. Until all
        these rites have been performed, none of the people may leave the
        kraal or have any intercourse whatever with others; but when the
        ceremonies have been duly performed, the people are pronounced clean,
        and may again associate with their neighbours. However, for some
        months afterwards none of the livestock of the kraal and few other
        things belonging to it are allowed to pass into other hands, whether
        by way of sale or of gift.<a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507"

        supposed to be infected with a dangerous virus, which they might
        communicate to their neighbours; and the vaccination is intended to
        disinfect them as well as to protect them against the recurrence of a
        like calamity. Young Carib warriors used to be inoculated for the
        purpose of making them brave and hardy. Some time before the ceremony
        the lad who was to be operated on caught a bird of prey of a
        particular sort and kept it in captivity till the day appointed. When
        the time was come and friends had assembled to witness the ceremony,
        the father of the boy seized the bird by its legs and crushed its
        head by beating it on the head of his son, who dared not wince under
        the rain of blows that nearly stunned him. Next the father bruised
        and pounded the bird's flesh, and steeped it in water together with a
        certain spice; after which he scored and slashed his son's body in
        all directions, washed his wounds with the decoction, and gave him
        the bird's heart to eat, in order, as it was said, that he might be

        deemed necessary either that the mystical substance should be
        swallowed by the communicant, or that he should receive it by the
        more painful process of scarification and inoculation. Sometimes it
        is thought enough merely to smear or anoint him with it. Among some
        of the Australian blacks it used to be a common practice to kill a
        man, cut out his caul-fat, and rub themselves with it, in the belief
        that all the qualities, both physical and mental, which had
        distinguished the original owner of the fat, were thus communicated

        Wollaroi, another tribe of New South Wales, used to place the dead on

        the juices of putrefaction which exuded from the rotten body,
        believing that this made them strong. Others collected these juices
        in vessels, and the young men rubbed the stinking liquid into their

        conjecture that the motive has been similar. Again, the negroes of
        Southern Guinea regard the brain as the seat of wisdom, and think it
        a pity that, when a wise man dies, his brain and his wisdom should go
        to waste together. So they sever his head from his body and hang it
        up over a mass of chalk, which, as the head decays, receives the
        drippings of brain and wisdom. Any one who applies the precious
        dripping to his forehead is supposed to absorb thereby the
        intelligence of the dead.<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href=

        afterwards, when the corpse has begun to moulder in the grave,
        detaching the head from the body. The brain, heart, eyes and hairs of
        the body are then removed and mixed, according to a secret formula,
        with special incantations. When the compound is dry, the hunter rubs
        himself <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name=

        the Digger Indians of California, when a man died, it was customary
        to burn the body to ashes, mix the ashes with a thick resinous gum
        extracted from a pine-tree, and then smear the gum on the head of the
        mourner, where it was allowed to remain till it gradually wore

        motive for the custom is not mentioned, but it was probably, like the
        motive for the parallel custom of swallowing the ashes of the dead, a
        desire to participate in the powers and virtues of the departed. At a
        certain stage of the ceremonies by which, in the Andaman Islands, a
        boy is initiated into manhood, the chief takes the carcase of a boar
        and presses it heavily down on the shoulders, back, and limbs of the
        young man as he sits, silent and motionless, on the ground. This is
        done to make him brave and strong. Afterwards the animal is cut up,
        and its melted fat is poured over the novice, and rubbed into his
        body.<a id="noteref_516" name="noteref_516" href=

        one of these birds, he pokes out its eyes and allows the fluid to

        Nevertheless they esteem it wholesome for an infant of the clan to

        have their bodies anointed with kangaroo fat. Doubtless the intention
        alike of the eating and of the anointing is to impart to the man the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In ancient Mexico
        the priests of the god Tezcatlipoca, before they engaged in religious
        rites which tried the nerve, used to smear their bodies with a magic
        ointment, which had the effect of banishing all fear, so that they
        would confront wild beasts in their dens or slaughter people in
        sacrifice with the utmost indifference. The ointment which had this
        marvellous property was compounded of the ashes of venomous reptiles
        and insects, such as spiders, scorpions, centipedes, and vipers,
        which were brayed up in a mortar along with living specimens of the
        same creatures, tobacco, soot, and the ashes of black caterpillars.
        This precious substance was then set before the god in little pots,
        because they said it was his victuals; therefore they called it a
        divine food. And when the priests had besmeared themselves
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166"
        id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with it, they were ready to
        discharge the duties of their holy office by butchering their fellow
        men in the human shambles without one qualm of fear or one visiting
        of compassion. Moreover, an unction of this ointment was deemed a
        sovereign remedy for sickness and disease; hence they named it
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the divine physic”</span>; and sick people
        came from all quarters to the priests, as to their saviours, to have
        their ailing parts anointed with the divine physic and to be made

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the
        valuable qualities of an animal or of a person may be imparted to
        another by the more delicate and ethereal process of fumigation. This
        refined mode of cultivating the moral virtues is or used to be
        practised by the Caffres of South Africa. Thus in former times as
        soon as a baby was born, some dirt was scraped from the forearm and
        other parts of the father's body and mixed with special medicines.
        The mixture was then made to smoulder and the baby was fumigated or
        <span class="tei tei-q">“washed”</span> in the smoke. This ceremony
        was deemed of great importance, being the established way of
        communicating to the child a portion of the ancestral spirit
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">itongo</span></span>) through the physical
        medium of the father's dirt, to which the spirit naturally adheres.
        But while the dirt was endowed with this spiritual potency, the moral
        character of the infant depended in a large measure on the nature of
        the medicines with which the dirt was compounded, and accordingly
        much thought and skill were devoted to their selection and
        preparation. Foremost among the ingredients was a meteorite, burnt to
        a cinder and ground to powder. The effect of this powder, well mixed
        with the dirt, and introduced into the orifices of the child's body
        by means of smoke, is to close the anterior fontanelle of the baby's
        skull, to strengthen the bones of that important part of his person,
        to communicate vigour to his mind and courage to his disposition, and
        in general to brace and harden his whole system with the strength and
        hardness of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg
        167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        meteorite. Other ingredients which have a most beneficial effect are
        the powdered whiskers of a leopard, the claws of a lion, and the skin
        of a salamander. The mode of administering the medicine is as
        follows. You set fire to the compound, and while it smoulders, you
        hold the infant, wrapt up in a blanket, over the burning mass so as
        to compel it to inhale the smoke. To make sure of producing the
        desired effect, some of the powdered medicine is mixed with the
        baby's food.<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href=

        manner by holding the smouldering feather of a vulture under a baby's
        nose you render the child valiant and brave like a vulture, and if
        you do the same with a peacock's feather, your offspring will be,
        like a peacock, impavid and never dismayed by thunder or other
        terrible noises.<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is now easy to
        understand why a savage should desire to partake of the flesh of an
        animal or man whom he regards as divine. By eating the body of the
        god he shares in the god's attributes and powers. And when the god is
        a corn-god, the corn is his proper body; when he is a vine-god, the
        juice of the grape is his blood; and so by eating the bread and
        drinking the wine the worshipper partakes of the real body and blood
        of his god. Thus the drinking of wine in the rites of a vine-god like
        Dionysus is not an act of revelry, it is a solemn sacrament.<a id=

        time comes when reasonable men find it hard to understand how any one
        in his senses can suppose that by eating bread or drinking wine he
        consumes the body or blood of a deity. <span class="tei tei-q">“When
        we call corn Ceres and wine Bacchus,”</span> says Cicero,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“we use a common figure of speech; but do you

          killing and eating their farinaceous deities either in their proper
          form of corn, rice, and so forth, or in the borrowed shapes of
          animals and men. It remains to shew that hunting and pastoral
          tribes, as well as agricultural peoples, have been in the habit of
          killing the beings whom they worship. Among the worshipful beings
          or gods, if indeed they deserve to be dignified by that name, whom
          hunters and shepherds adore and kill are animals pure and simple,
          not animals regarded as embodiments of other supernatural beings.

          there stood in former days, not far from the brink of the great
          cliffs, the white mission-house of San Juan Capistrano. Among the
          monks who here exercised over a handful of wretched Indians the
          austere discipline of Catholic Spain, there was a certain Father
          Geronimo Boscana who has bequeathed to us a precious record of the
          customs and superstitions of his savage flock. Thus he tells us
          that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg

          Acagchemem tribe adored the great buzzard, and that once a year
          they celebrated a great festival called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Panes</span></span> or bird-feast in its
          honour. The day selected for the festival was made known to the
          public on the evening before its celebration and preparations were
          at once made for the erection of a special temple (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vanquech</span></span>), which seems to have
          been a circular or oval enclosure of stakes with the stuffed skin
          of a coyote or prairie-wolf set up on a hurdle to represent the god
          Chinigchinich. When the temple was ready, the bird was carried into
          it in solemn procession and laid on an altar erected for the
          purpose. Then all the young women, whether married or single, began
          to run to and fro, as if distracted, some in one direction and some
          in another, while the elders of both sexes remained silent
          spectators of the scene, and the captains, tricked out in paint and
          feathers, danced round their adored bird. These ceremonies being
          concluded, they seized upon the bird and carried it to the
          principal temple, all the assembly uniting in the grand display,
          and the captains dancing and singing at the head of the procession.
          Arrived at the temple, they killed the bird without losing a drop
          of its blood. The skin was removed entire and preserved with the
          feathers as a relic or for the purpose of making the festal garment
          or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">paelt</span></span>. The carcase was buried in
          a hole in the temple, and the old women gathered round the grave
          weeping and moaning bitterly, while they threw various kinds of
          seeds or pieces of food on it, crying out, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why did you run away? Would you not have been better
          with us? you would have made <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          this ceremony was concluded, the dancing was resumed and kept up
          for three days and nights. They said that the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          off to the mountains and there been changed into a bird by the god
          Chinigchinich. They believed that though they sacrificed the bird
          annually, she came to life again and returned to her home in the
          mountains. Moreover they thought that <span class="tei tei-q">“as
          often as the bird was killed, it became multiplied; because every
          year all the different Capitanes celebrated the same feast of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unity in
          multiplicity thus postulated by the Californians is very noticeable
          and helps to explain their motive for killing the divine bird. The
          notion of the life of a species as distinct from that of an
          individual, easy and obvious as it seems to us, appears to be one
          which the Californian savage cannot grasp. He is unable to conceive
          the life of the species otherwise than as an individual life, and
          therefore as exposed to the same dangers and calamities which
          menace and finally destroy the life of the individual. Apparently
          he imagines that a species left to itself will grow old and die
          like an individual, and that therefore some step must be taken to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name=
          "Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> save from extinction
          the particular species which he regards as divine. The only means
          he can think of to avert the catastrophe is to kill a member of the
          species in whose veins the tide of life is still running strong,
          and has not yet stagnated among the fens of old age. The life thus
          diverted from one channel will flow, he fancies, more freshly and
          freely in a new one; in other words, the slain animal will revive
          and enter on a new term of life with all the spring and energy of
          youth. To us this reasoning is transparently absurd, but so too is
          the custom. If a better explanation, that is, one more consonant
          with the facts and with the principles of savage thought, can be
          given of the custom, I will willingly withdraw the one here
          proposed. A similar confusion, it may be noted, between the
          individual life and the life of the species was made by the
          Samoans. Each family had for its god a particular species of
          animal; yet the death of one of these animals, for example an owl,
          was not the death of the god, <span class="tei tei-q">“he was
          supposed to be yet alive, and incarnate in all the owls in
          existence.”</span><a id="noteref_528" name="noteref_528" href=

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rude
          Californian rite which we have just considered has a close parallel
          in the religion of ancient Egypt. The Thebans and all other
          Egyptians who worshipped the Theban god Ammon held rams to be
          sacred, and would not sacrifice them. But once a year at the
          festival of Ammon they killed a ram, skinned it, and clothed the
          image of the god in the skin. Then they mourned over the ram and
          buried it in a sacred tomb. The custom was explained by a story
          that Zeus had once exhibited himself to Hercules clad in the fleece
          and wearing the head of a ram.<a id="noteref_529" name=
          "noteref_529" href="#note_529"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">529</span></span></a> Of
          course the ram in this case was simply the beast-god of Thebes, as
          the wolf was the beast-god of Lycopolis, and the goat was the
          beast-god of Mendes. In other words, the ram was Ammon himself. On
          the monuments, it is true, Ammon appears in semi-human form with
          the body of a man and the head of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> ram.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> But
          this only shews that he was in the usual chrysalis state through
          which beast-gods regularly pass before they emerge as full-blown
          anthropomorphic gods. The ram, therefore, was killed, not as a
          sacrifice to Ammon, but as the god himself, whose identity with the
          beast is plainly shewn by the custom of clothing his image in the
          skin of the slain ram. The reason for thus killing the ram-god
          annually may have been that which I have assigned for the general
          custom of killing a god and for the special Californian custom of
          killing the divine buzzard. As applied to Egypt, this explanation
          is supported by the analogy of the bull-god Apis, who was not
          suffered to outlive a certain term of years.<a id="noteref_531"
          name="noteref_531" href="#note_531"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a> The
          intention of thus putting a limit to the life of the human god was,
          as I have argued, to secure him from the weakness and frailty of
          age. The same reasoning would explain the custom—probably an older
          one—of putting the beast-god to death annually, as was done with
          the ram of Thebes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One point in the
          Theban ritual—the application of the skin to the image of the
          god—deserves particular attention. If the god was at first the
          living ram, his representation by an image must have originated
          later. But how did it originate? One answer to this question is
          perhaps furnished by the practice of preserving the skin of the
          animal which is slain as divine. The Californians, as we have seen,
          preserved the skin of the buzzard; and the skin of the goat, which
          is killed on the harvest-field as a representative of the
          corn-spirit, is kept for various superstitious purposes.<a id=
          "noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="#note_532"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a> The
          skin in fact was kept as a token or memorial of the god, or rather
          as containing in it a part of the divine life, and it had only to
          be stuffed or stretched upon a frame to become a regular image of
          him. At first an image of this kind would be renewed
          annually,<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href=
          "#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          "page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> skin of the slain animal. But from annual
          images to permanent images the transition is easy. We have seen
          that the older custom of cutting a new May-tree every year was
          superseded by the practice of maintaining a permanent May-pole,
          which was, however, annually decked with fresh leaves and flowers,
          and even surmounted each year by a fresh young tree.<a id=
          "noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="#note_534"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a>
          Similarly when the stuffed skin, as a representative of the god,
          was replaced by a permanent image of him in wood, stone, or metal,
          the permanent image was annually clad in the fresh skin of the
          slain animal. When this stage had been reached, the custom of
          killing the ram came naturally to be interpreted as a sacrifice
          offered to the image, and was explained by a story like that of
          Ammon and Hercules.</p>

          their guardian deity, who can do them good or ill, bestow riches or
          inflict disease and death. The skin of one of these reptiles is
          hung tail downwards from a branch of the highest tree in the public
          square, and the placing of it on the tree is an annual ceremony. As
          soon as the ceremony is over, all children born within the past

          have no relation to agriculture, and may therefore be presumed to
          date from the hunting or pastoral stage of society. The same may be
          said of the following custom, though the people who practise it—the
          Zuni Indians of New Mexico—are now settled in walled villages or
          towns of a peculiar type, and practise agriculture and the arts of
          pottery and weaving. But the Zuni custom is marked by certain
          features which appear to place it in a somewhat different class

          exhausted, on a roll of skins which had been placed for him, and
          tenderly laid the turtle on the floor. No sooner did the creature
          find itself at liberty than it made off as fast as its lame legs
          would take it. Of one accord, the family forsook dish, spoon, and
          drinking-cup, and grabbing from a sacred meal-bowl whole handfuls
          of the contents, hurriedly followed the turtle about the room, into
          dark corners, around water-jars, behind the grinding-troughs, and
          out into the middle of the floor again, praying and scattering meal
          on its back as they went. At last, strange to say, it approached
          the foot-sore man who had brought it.</span></p>

          from his palm deeply and long, at the same time invoking the favour
          of the gods. Then he leaned his chin upon his hand, and with large,
          wistful eyes regarded his ugly captive as it sprawled about,
          blinking its meal-bedimmed eyes, and clawing the smooth floor in
          memory of its native element. At this juncture I ventured a

          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em>
          know?’</span> he mused. Turning to the blinded turtle again:
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ah! my poor dear lost child or parent, my
          sister or brother to have been! Who knows which? Maybe my own

          weeping most pathetically, and, tremulous with sobs, which were
          echoed by the women and children, he buried his face in his hands.
          Filled with sympathy for his grief, however mistaken, I raised the
          turtle to my lips and kissed its cold shell; then depositing it on
          the floor, hastily left the grief-stricken family to their sorrows.
          Next day, with prayers and tender beseechings, plumes, and
          offerings, the poor turtle was killed, and its flesh and bones were
          removed and deposited in the little river, that it might
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘return once more to eternal life among its
          comrades in the dark waters of the lake of the dead.’</span> The

          and, covered by a piece of buckskin, it still hangs from the

          buy it for a ladle; loaded with indignant reproaches, he was turned

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this custom
          we find expressed in the clearest way a belief in the
          transmigration of human souls into the bodies of turtles.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a> The
          theory of transmigration is held by the Moqui Indians, who belong
          to the same race as the Zunis. The Moquis are divided into totem
          clans—the Bear clan, Deer clan, Wolf clan, Hare clan, and so on;
          they believe that the ancestors of the clans were bears, deer,
          wolves, hares, and so forth; and that at death the members of each
          clan become bears, deer, and so on according to the particular clan
          to which they belonged.<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href=
          "#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a> The
          Zuni are also divided into clans, the totems of which agree closely
          with those of the Moquis, and one of their totems is the
          turtle.<a id="noteref_542" name="noteref_542" href=
          "#note_542"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">542</span></span></a> Thus
          their belief in transmigration into the turtle is probably one of
          the regular articles of their totem faith.<a id="noteref_543" name=

          then is the meaning of killing a turtle in which the soul of a
          kinsman is believed to be present? Apparently the object is to keep
          up a communication with the other world in which the souls of the
          departed are believed to be assembled in the form of turtles. It is
          a common belief that the spirits of the dead return occasionally to
          their old homes; and accordingly the unseen visitors are welcomed
          and feasted by the living, and then sent upon their way.<a id=
          "noteref_544" name="noteref_544" href="#note_544"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a> In
          the Zuni ceremony the dead are fetched home in the form of turtles,
          and the killing of the turtles is the way of sending back the souls
          to the spirit-land. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg
          179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Thus the general explanation given above of the custom of killing a
          god seems inapplicable to the Zuni custom, the true meaning of
          which is somewhat obscure. Nor is the obscurity which hangs over
          the subject entirely dissipated by a later and fuller account which
          we possess of the ceremony. From it we learn that the ceremony
          forms part of the elaborate ritual which these Indians observe at
          the midsummer solstice for the purpose of ensuring an abundant
          supply of rain for the crops. Envoys are despatched to bring
          <span class="tei tei-q">“their otherselves, the tortoises,”</span>
          from the sacred lake Kothluwalawa, to which the souls of the dead
          are believed to repair. When the creatures have thus been solemnly
          brought to Zuni, they are placed in a bowl of water and dances are
          performed beside them by men in costume, who personate gods and
          goddesses. <span class="tei tei-q">“After the ceremonial the
          tortoises are taken home by those who caught them and are hung by
          their necks to the rafters till morning, when they are thrown into
          pots of boiling water. The eggs are considered a great delicacy.
          The meat is seldom touched except as a medicine, which is curative
          for cutaneous diseases. Part of the meat is deposited in the river
          with <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kóhakwa</span></span> (white shell beads) and
          turquoise beads as offerings to Council of the Gods.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href="#note_545"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a> This
          account at all events confirms the inference that the tortoises are
          supposed to be reincarnations of the human dead, for they are
          called the <span class="tei tei-q">“otherselves”</span> of the
          Zuni; indeed, what else should they be than the souls of the dead
          in the bodies of tortoises seeing that they come from the haunted
          lake? As the principal object of the prayers uttered and of the
          dances performed at these midsummer ceremonies appears to be to
          procure rain for the crops, it may be that the intention of
          bringing the tortoises to Zuni and dancing before them is to
          intercede with the ancestral spirits, incarnate in the animals,
          that they may be pleased to exert their power over the waters of
          heaven for the benefit of their living descendants.</p>

          yet as a totem; for they do not call themselves bears, and they
          kill and eat the animal freely. However, they have a legend of a
          woman who had a son by a bear; and many of them who dwell in the
          mountains pride themselves on being descended from a bear. Such
          people are called <span class="tei tei-q">“Descendants of the
          bear”</span> (<span lang="ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          say, <span class="tei tei-q">“As for me, I am a child of the god of
          the mountains; I am descended from the divine one who rules in the
          mountains,”</span> meaning by <span class="tei tei-q">“the god of

          therefore possible that, as our principal authority, the Rev. J.
          Batchelor, believes, the bear may have been the totem of an Aino
          clan; but even if that were so it would not explain the respect
          shewn for the animal by the whole Aino people.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is the
          bear-festival of the Aino which concerns us here. Towards the end
          of winter a bear cub is caught and brought into the village. If it
          is very small, it is suckled by an Aino woman, but should there be
          no woman able to suckle it, the little animal is fed from the hand
          or the mouth. If it cries loudly and long for its mother, as it is
          apt to do, its owner will take it to his bosom and let it sleep
          with him for a few nights, thus dispelling its fears and sense of
          loneliness. During the day it plays about in the hut with the
          children and is treated with great affection. But when the cub
          grows big enough to pain people by hugging or scratching them, he
          is shut up in a strong wooden cage, where he stays generally for
          two or three years, fed on fish and millet porridge, till it is
          time for him to be killed and eaten.<a id="noteref_564" name=

          Yezo the festival is generally celebrated in September or October.
          Before it takes place the Aino apologise to their gods, alleging
          that they have treated the bear kindly as long as they could, now
          they can feed him no longer, and are obliged to kill him. A man who
          gives a bear-feast invites his relations and friends; in a small
          village nearly the whole community takes part in the feast; indeed,
          guests from distant villages are invited and generally come,
          allured by the prospect of getting drunk for nothing. The form of
          invitation runs somewhat as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“I, so
          and so, am about to sacrifice the dear little divine thing who
          resides among the mountains. My friends and masters, come ye to the
          feast; we will then unite in the great pleasure of sending the god
          away. Come.”</span><a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href=
          "#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> When
          all the people are assembled in front of the cage, an orator chosen
          for the purpose addresses the bear and tells it that they are about
          to send it forth to its ancestors. He craves pardon for what they
          are about to do to it, hopes it will not be angry, and comforts it
          by assuring the animal that many of the sacred whittled sticks
          (<span lang="ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inao</span></span>) and plenty of cakes and
          wine will be sent with it on the long journey. One speech of this
          sort which Mr. Batchelor heard ran as follows: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O thou divine one, thou wast sent into the world for
          us to hunt. O thou precious little divinity, we worship thee; pray
          hear our prayer. We have nourished thee and brought thee up with a
          deal of pains and trouble, all because we love thee so. Now, as
          thou hast grown big, we are about to send thee to thy father and
          mother. When thou comest to them please speak well of us, and tell
          them how kind we have been; please come to us again and we will
          sacrifice thee.”</span> Having been secured with ropes, the bear is
          then let out of the cage and assailed with a shower of blunt arrows
          in order to rouse it to fury. When it has spent itself in vain
          struggles, it is tied up to a stake, gagged and strangled, its neck
          being placed between two poles, which are then violently
          compressed, all the people eagerly helping to squeeze the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name=
          "Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> animal to death. An
          arrow is also discharged into the beast's heart by a good marksman,
          but so as not to shed blood, for they think that it would be very
          unlucky if any of the blood were to drip on the ground. However,
          the men sometimes drink the warm blood of the bear "that the
          courage and other virtues it possesses may pass into them"; and
          sometimes they besmear themselves and their clothes with the blood
          in order to ensure success in hunting. When the animal has been
          strangled to death, it is skinned and its head is cut off and set
          in the east window of the house, where a piece of its own flesh is
          placed under its snout, together with a cup of its own meat boiled,
          some millet dumplings, and dried fish. Prayers are then addressed
          to the dead animal; amongst other things it is sometimes invited,
          after going away to its father and mother, to return into the world
          in order that it may again be reared for sacrifice. When the bear
          is supposed to have finished eating its own flesh, the man who
          presides at the feast takes the cup containing the boiled meat,
          salutes it, and divides the contents between all the company
          present: every person, young and old alike, must taste a little.
          The cup is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the cup of
          offering”</span> because it has just been offered to the dead bear.
          When the rest of the flesh has been cooked, it is shared out in
          like manner among all the people, everybody partaking of at least a
          morsel; not to partake of the feast would be equivalent to
          excommunication, it would be to place the recreant outside the pale
          of Aino fellowship. Formerly every particle of the bear, except the
          bones, had to be eaten up at the banquet, but this rule is now
          relaxed. The head, on being detached from the skin, is set up on a
          long pole beside the sacred wands (<span lang="ja" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inao</span></span>) outside of the house,
          where it remains till nothing but the bare white skull is left.
          Skulls so set up are worshipped not only at the time of the
          festival, but very often as long as they last. The Aino assured Mr.
          Batchelor that they really do believe the spirits of the worshipful
          animals to reside in the skulls; that is why they address them as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“divine preservers”</span> and <span class=

          of Yezo or Yesso. As his description of the rite contains some
          interesting particulars not mentioned in the foregoing account, it

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On entering the
          hut he found about thirty Aino present, men, women, and children,
          all dressed in their best. The master of the house first offered a
          libation on the fireplace to the god of the fire, and the guests
          followed his example. Then a libation was offered to the house-god
          in his sacred corner of the hut. Meanwhile the housewife, who had
          nursed the bear, sat by herself, silent and sad, bursting now and
          then into tears. Her grief was obviously unaffected, and it
          deepened as the festival went on. Next, the master of the house and
          some of the guests went out of the hut and offered libations before
          the bear's cage. A few drops were presented to the bear in a
          saucer, which he at once upset. Then the women and girls danced
          round the cage, their faces turned towards it, their knees slightly
          bent, rising and hopping on their toes. As they danced they clapped
          their hands and sang a monotonous song. The housewife and a few old
          women, who might have nursed many bears, danced tearfully,
          stretching out their arms to the bear, and addressing it in terms
          of endearment. The young folks were less affected; they laughed as
          well as sang. Disturbed by the noise, the bear began to rush about
          his cage and howl lamentably. Next libations were offered at the
          <span lang="ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inao (inabos)</span></span> or sacred wands
          which stand outside of an Aino hut. These wands are about a couple
          of feet high, and are whittled at the top into spiral
          shavings.<a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href=
          "#note_569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          leaves attached to them had been set up for the festival. This is
          regularly done when a bear is killed; the leaves mean that the
          animal may come to life again. Then the bear was let out of his
          cage, a rope was thrown round his neck, and he was led about in the
          neighbourhood of the hut. While this was being done the men, headed
          by a chief, shot at the beast with arrows tipped with wooden
          buttons. Dr. Scheube had to do so also. Then the bear was taken
          before the sacred wands, a stick was put in his mouth, nine men
          knelt on him and pressed his neck against a beam. In five minutes
          the animal had expired without uttering a sound. Meantime the women
          and girls had taken post behind the men, where they danced,
          lamenting, and beating the men who were killing the bear. The
          bear's carcase was next placed on the mat before the sacred wands;
          and a sword and quiver, taken from the wands, were hung round the
          beast's neck. Being a she-bear, it was also adorned with a necklace
          and ear-rings. Then food and drink were offered to it, in the shape
          of millet-broth, millet-cakes, and a pot of <span lang="ja" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sake</span></span>. The men now sat down on
          mats before the dead bear, offered libations to it, and drank deep.
          Meanwhile the women and girls had laid aside all marks of sorrow,
          and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name=
          "Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> danced merrily, none
          more merrily than the old women. When the mirth was at its height
          two young Aino, who had let the bear out of his cage, mounted the
          roof of the hut and threw cakes of millet among the company, who
          all scrambled for them without distinction of age or sex. The bear
          was next skinned and disembowelled, and the trunk severed from the
          head, to which the skin was left hanging. The blood, caught in
          cups, was eagerly swallowed by the men. None of the women or
          children appeared to drink the blood, though custom did not forbid
          them to do so. The liver was cut in small pieces and eaten raw,
          with salt, the women and children getting their share. The flesh
          and the rest of the vitals were taken into the house to be kept
          till the next day but one, and then to be divided among the persons
          who had been present at the feast. Blood and liver were offered to
          Dr. Scheube. While the bear was being disembowelled, the women and
          girls danced the same dance which they had danced at the
          beginning—not, however, round the cage, but in front of the sacred
          wands. At this dance the old women, who had been merry a moment
          before, again shed tears freely. After the brain had been extracted
          from the bear's head and swallowed with salt, the skull, detached
          from the skin, was hung on a pole beside the sacred wands. The
          stick with which the bear had been gagged was also fastened to the
          pole, and so were the sword and quiver which had been hung on the
          carcase. The latter were removed in about an hour, but the rest
          remained standing. The whole company, men and women, danced noisily
          before the pole; and another drinking-bout, in which the women
          joined, closed the festival.</p>

          first published account of the bear-feast of the Aino is one which
          was given to the world by a Japanese writer in 1652. It has been
          translated into French and runs thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“When
          they find a young bear, they bring it home, and the wife suckles
          it. When it is grown they feed it with fish and fowl and kill it in
          winter for the sake of the liver, which they esteem an antidote to
          poison, the worms, colic, and disorders of the stomach. It is of a
          very bitter taste, and is good for nothing if the bear has been
          killed in summer. This butchery begins in the first Japanese month.

          they put the animal's head between two long poles, which are
          squeezed together by fifty or sixty people, both men and women.
          When the bear is dead they eat his flesh, keep the liver as a
          medicine, and sell the skin, which is black and commonly six feet
          long, but the longest measure twelve feet. As soon as he is
          skinned, the persons who nourished the beast begin to bewail him;
          afterwards they make little cakes to regale those who helped

          are told that they do not look upon the bear as a god but only as a
          messenger whom they despatch with various commissions to the god of
          the forest. The animal is kept for about two years in a cage, and
          then killed at a festival, which always takes place in winter and
          at night. The day before the sacrifice is devoted to lamentation,
          old women relieving each other in the duty of weeping and groaning
          in front of the bear's cage. Then about the middle of the night or
          very early in the morning an orator makes a long speech to the

          to offer you a good dinner, the best you have ever eaten among us,
          and we will all weep for you together. The Aino who will kill you
          is the best shot among us. There he is, he weeps and asks your
          forgiveness; you will feel almost nothing, it will be done so
          quickly. We cannot feed you always, as you will understand. We have
          done enough for you; it is now your turn to sacrifice yourself for
          us. You will ask God to send us, for the winter, plenty of otters
          and sables, and for the summer, seals and fish in abundance. Do not
          forget our messages, we love you much, and our children will never
          forget you.”</span> When the bear has partaken of his last meal
          amid the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg
          189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          general emotion of the spectators, the old women weeping afresh and
          the men uttering stifled cries, he is strapped, not without
          difficulty and danger, and being let out of the cage is led on
          leash or dragged, according to the state of his temper, thrice
          round his cage, then round his master's house, and lastly round the
          house of the orator. Thereupon he is tied up to a tree, which is
          decked with sacred whittled sticks (<span lang="ja" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inao</span></span>) of the usual sort; and the
          orator again addresses him in a long harangue, which sometimes
          lasts till the day is beginning to break. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Remember,”</span> he cries, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“remember! I remind you of your whole life and of the
          services we have rendered you. It is now for you to do your duty.
          Do not forget what I have asked of you. You will tell the gods to
          give us riches, that our hunters may return from the forest laden
          with rare furs and animals good to eat; that our fishers may find
          troops of seals on the shore and in the sea, and that their nets
          may crack under the weight of the fish. We have no hope but in you.
          The evil spirits laugh at us, and too often they are unfavourable
          and malignant to us, but they will bow before you. We have given
          you food and joy and health; now we kill you in order that you may
          in return send riches to us and to our children.”</span> To this
          discourse the bear, more and more surly and agitated, listens
          without conviction; round and round the tree he paces and howls
          lamentably, till, just as the first beams of the rising sun light
          up the scene, an archer speeds an arrow to his heart. No sooner has
          he done so, than the marksman throws away his bow and flings
          himself on the ground, and the old men and women do the same,
          weeping and sobbing. Then they offer the dead beast a repast of
          rice and wild potatoes, and having spoken to him in terms of pity
          and thanked him for what he has done and suffered, they cut off his
          head and paws and keep them as sacred things. A banquet on the
          flesh and blood of the bear follows. Women were formerly excluded
          from it, but now they share with the men. The blood is drunk warm
          by all present; the flesh is boiled, custom forbids it to be
          roasted. And as the relics of the bear may not enter the house by
          the door, and Aino houses in Saghalien have no windows, a man gets
          up on the roof and lets the flesh, the head, and the skin down
          through <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg
          190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the smoke-hole. Rice and wild potatoes are then offered to the
          head, and a pipe, tobacco, and matches are considerately placed
          beside it. Custom requires that the guests should eat up the whole
          animal before they depart: the use of salt and pepper at the meal
          is forbidden; and no morsel of the flesh may be given to the dogs.
          When the banquet is over, the head is carried away into the depth
          of the forest and deposited on a heap of bears' skulls, the
          bleached and mouldering relics of similar festivals in the
          past.<a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href=

          dragged through the village. But first they lead him to the bank of
          the river, for this is believed to ensure abundance of fish to each
          family. He is then taken into every house in the village, where
          fish, brandy, and so forth are offered to him. Some people
          prostrate themselves before the beast. His entrance into a house is
          supposed to bring a blessing; and if he snuffs at the food offered
          to him, this also is a blessing. Nevertheless they tease and worry,
          poke and tickle the animal continually, so that he is surly and

          head is then cut off, decked with shavings, and placed on the table

          worship him. Then his flesh is roasted and eaten in special vessels

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of these
          bear-festivals was witnessed by the Russian traveller L. von
          Schrenck and his companions at the Gilyak village of Tebach in
          January 1856. From his detailed report of the ceremony we may
          gather some particulars which are not noticed in the briefer
          accounts which I have just summarised. The bear, he tells us, plays
          a great part in the life of all the peoples inhabiting the region
          of the Amoor and Siberia as far as Kamtchatka, but among none of
          them is his importance greater than among the Gilyaks. The immense
          size which the animal attains in the valley of the Amoor, his
          ferocity whetted by hunger, and the frequency of his appearance,
          all combine to make him the most dreaded beast of prey in the
          country. No wonder, therefore, that the fancy of the Gilyaks is
          busied with him and surrounds him, both in life and in death, with
          a sort of halo of superstitious fear. Thus, for example, it is
          thought that if a Gilyak falls in combat with a bear, his soul
          transmigrates into the body of the beast. Nevertheless his flesh
          has an irresistible attraction for the Gilyak palate, especially
          when the animal has been kept in captivity for some time and
          fattened on fish, which gives the flesh, in the opinion of the
          Gilyaks, a peculiarly delicious flavour. But in order to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name=
          "Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> enjoy this dainty
          with impunity they deem it needful to perform a long series of
          ceremonies, of which the intention is to delude the living bear by
          a show of respect, and to appease the anger of the dead animal by
          the homage paid to his departed spirit. The marks of respect begin
          as soon as the beast is captured. He is brought home in triumph and
          kept in a cage, where all the villagers take it in turns to feed
          him. For although he may have been captured or purchased by one
          man, he belongs in a manner to the whole village. His flesh will
          furnish a common feast, and hence all must contribute to support
          him in his life. His diet consists exclusively of raw or dried
          fish, water, and a sort of porridge compounded of powdered
          fish-skins, train-oil, and whortle-berries. The length of time he
          is kept in captivity depends on his age. Old bears are kept only a
          few months; cubs are kept till they are full-grown. A thick layer
          of fat on the captive bear gives the signal for the festival, which
          is always held in winter, generally in December but sometimes in
          January or February. At the festival witnessed by the Russian
          travellers, which lasted a good many days, three bears were killed
          and eaten. More than once the animals were led about in procession
          and compelled to enter every house in the village, where they were
          fed as a mark of honour, and to shew that they were welcome guests.
          But before the beasts set out on this round of visits, the Gilyaks
          played at skipping-rope in presence, and perhaps, as L. von
          Schrenck inclined to believe, in honour of the animals. The night
          before they were killed, the three bears were led by moonlight a
          long way on the ice of the frozen river. That night no one in the
          village might sleep. Next day, after the animals had been again led
          down the steep bank to the river, and conducted thrice round the
          hole in the ice from which the women of the village drew their
          water, they were taken to an appointed place not far from the
          village, and shot to death with arrows. The place of sacrifice or
          execution was marked as holy by being surrounded with whittled
          sticks, from the tops of which shavings hung in curls. Such sticks
          are with the Gilyaks, as with the Aino, the regular symbols that
          accompany all religious ceremonies. Before the bears <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> received the fatal shafts from two
          young men chosen for the purpose, the boys were allowed to
          discharge their small but not always harmless arrows at the beasts.
          As soon as the carcases had been cut up, the skins with the heads
          attached to them were set up in a wooden cage in such a way as to
          make it appear that the animals had entered the cage and were
          looking out of it. The blood which flowed from the bears on the
          spot where they were killed was immediately covered up with snow,
          to prevent any one from accidentally treading on it, a thing which
          was strictly tabooed.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the house
          has been arranged and decorated for their reception, the skins of
          the bears, with their heads attached to them, are brought into it,
          not however by the door, but through a window, and then hung on a
          sort of scaffold opposite the hearth on which the flesh is to be
          cooked. This ceremony of bringing the bears' skins into the house
          by the window was not witnessed by the Russian travellers, who only
          learned of it at second hand. They were told that when the thin
          disc of fish-skin, which is the substitute for a pane of glass in
          the window, has been replaced after the passage of the bear-skins,
          a figure of a toad made of birch bark is affixed to it on the
          outside, while inside the house a figure of a bear dressed in
          Gilyak costume is set on the bench of honour. The meaning of this
          part of the ceremony, as it is conjecturally interpreted by Von
          Schrenck, may be as follows. The toad is a creature that has a very
          evil reputation with the Gilyaks, and accordingly they attempt to
          lay upon it, as on a scapegoat, the guilt of the slaughter of the
          worshipful bear. Hence its effigy is excluded from the house and
          has to remain outside at the window, a witness of its own misdeeds;
          whereas the bear is brought into the house and treated as an
          honoured guest, for fish and flesh are laid before it, and its
          effigy, dressed in Gilyak costume, is seated on the bench of
          honour.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boiling of
          the bears' flesh among the Gilyaks is done only by the oldest men,
          whose high privilege it is; women and children, young men and boys
          have no part in it. The task is performed slowly and deliberately,
          with a certain solemnity. On the occasion described by the Russian
          travellers the kettle was first of all surrounded with <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a thick wreath of shavings, and then
          filled with snow, for the use of water to cook bear's flesh is
          forbidden. Meanwhile a large wooden trough, richly adorned with
          arabesques and carvings of all sorts, was hung immediately under
          the snouts of the bears; on one side of the trough was carved in
          relief a bear, on the other side a toad. When the carcases were
          being cut up, each leg was laid on the ground in front of the
          bears, as if to ask their leave, before being placed in the kettle;
          and the boiled flesh was fished out of the kettle with an iron
          hook, and set in the trough before the bears, in order that they
          might be the first to taste of their own flesh. As fast, too, as
          the fat was cut in strips it was hung up in front of the bears, and
          afterwards laid in a small wooden trough on the ground before them.
          Last of all the inner organs of the beasts were cut up and placed
          in small vessels. At the same time the women made bandages out of
          parti-coloured rags, and after sunset these bandages were tied
          round the bears' snouts just below the eyes <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in order to dry the tears that flowed from
          them.”</span> To each bandage, just below the eyes, was attached a
          figure of a toad cut out of birch bark. The meaning of this appears
          to be, as Von Schrenck conjectured, as follows. With the carving of
          his inner organs, the heart, liver, and so forth, the bear sees
          that his fate is sealed, and sheds some natural tears at his hard
          lot. These tears trickle down his snout over the figure of the
          toad, which the poor deluded bear accordingly regards as the author
          of all the mischief. For he cannot blame the Gilyaks, who have
          treated him so kindly. Have they not received him as a guest in
          their house, set him on the seat of honour, given him of their
          best, and done nothing but with his knowledge and permission?
          Finally, have not their women shewn him the last delicate mark of
          attention by drying the tears that flow from his eyes and trickle
          down his nose? Surely then he cannot think that these kindly folk
          have done him any harm; it was all the fault of the unprincipled
          toad.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever may be
          thought of this explanation, as soon as the ceremony of wiping away
          poor bruin's tears had been performed, the assembled Gilyaks set to
          work in earnest to devour his flesh. The broth obtained by boiling
          the meat <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg
          195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          had already been partaken of. The wooden bowls, platters, and
          spoons out of which the Gilyaks eat the broth and flesh of the
          bears on these occasions are always made specially for the purpose
          at the festival and only then; they are elaborately ornamented with
          carved figures of bears and other devices that refer to the animal
          or the festival, and the people have a strong superstitious scruple
          against parting with them. While the festival lasts, no salt may be
          used in cooking the bear's flesh or indeed any other food; and no
          flesh of any kind may be roasted, for the bear would hear the
          hissing and sputtering of the roasting flesh, and would be very
          angry. After the bones had been picked clean they were put back in
          the kettle in which the flesh had been boiled. And when the festal
          meal was over, an old man took his stand at the door of the house
          with a branch of fir in his hand, with which, as the people passed
          out, he gave a light blow to every one who had eaten of the bear's
          flesh or fat, perhaps as a punishment for their treatment of the
          worshipful animal. In the afternoon of the same day the women
          performed a strange dance. Only one woman danced at a time,
          throwing the upper part of her body into the oddest postures, while
          she held in her hands a branch of fir or a kind of wooden
          castanets. The other women meanwhile played an accompaniment in a
          peculiar rhythm by drumming on the beams of the house with clubs.
          The dance reminded one of the Russian travellers of the bear-dance
          which he had seen danced by the women of Kamtchatka. Von Schrenck
          believes, though he has not positive evidence, that after the fat
          and flesh of the bear have been consumed, his skull is cleft with
          an axe, and the brain taken out and eaten. Then the bones and the
          skull are solemnly carried out by the oldest people to a place in
          the forest not far from the village. There all the bones except the
          skull are buried. After that a young tree is felled a few inches
          above the ground, its stump cleft, and the skull wedged into the
          cleft. When the grass grows over the spot, the skull disappears
          from view, and that is the end of the bear.<a id="noteref_576"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          description of the bear-festivals of the Gilyaks has been given us
          by Mr. Leo Sternberg.<a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href=

          agrees substantially with the foregoing accounts, but a few
          particulars in it may be noted. According to Mr. Sternberg, the
          festival is usually held in honour of a deceased relation: the next
          of kin either buys or catches a bear cub and nurtures it for two or
          three years till it is ready for the sacrifice. Only certain
          distinguished guests (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Narch-en</span></span>) are privileged to
          partake of the bear's flesh, but the host and members of his clan
          eat a broth made from the flesh; great quantities of this broth are
          prepared and consumed on the occasion. The guests of honour
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Narch-en</span></span>) must belong to the
          clan into which the host's daughters and the other women of his
          clan are married: one of these guests, usually the host's
          son-in-law, is entrusted with the duty of shooting the bear dead
          with an arrow. The skin, head, and flesh of the slain bear are
          brought into the house not through the door but through the
          smoke-hole; a quiver full of arrows is laid under the head and
          beside it are deposited tobacco, sugar, and other food. The soul of
          the bear is supposed to carry off the souls of these things with it
          on the far journey. A special vessel is used for cooking the bear's
          flesh, and the fire must be kindled by a sacred apparatus of flint
          and steel, which belongs to the clan and is handed down from
          generation to generation, but which is never used to light fires
          except on these solemn occasions. Of all the many viands cooked for
          the consumption of the assembled people a portion is placed in a
          special vessel and set before the bear's head: this is called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“feeding the head.”</span> After the bear
          has been killed, dogs are sacrificed in couples of male and female.
          Before being throttled, they are fed and invited to go to their
          lord on the highest mountain, to change their skins, and to return
          next year in the form of bears. The soul of the dead bear departs
          to the same lord, who is also lord of the primaeval forest; it goes
          away laden with the offerings that have been made to it, and
          attended by the souls of the dogs and also by the souls of the
          sacred whittled sticks, which figure prominently at the
          festival.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Goldi,
          neighbours of the Gilyaks, treat the bear in much the same way.
          They hunt and kill it; but sometimes they capture a live bear and
          keep him in a cage, feeding him well and calling him their son and
          brother. Then at a great festival he is taken from his cage,
          paraded about with marked consideration, and afterwards killed and
          eaten. <span class="tei tei-q">“The skull, jaw-bones, and ears are
          then suspended on a tree, as an antidote against evil spirits; but
          the flesh is eaten and much relished, for they believe that all who

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Orotchis,
          another Tunguzian people of the region of the Amoor, hold
          bear-festivals of the same general character. Any one who catches a
          bear cub considers it his bounden duty to rear it in a cage for
          about three years, in order at the end of that time to kill it
          publicly and eat the flesh with his friends. The feasts being
          public, though organised by individuals, the people try to have one
          in each Orotchi village every year in turn. When the bear is taken
          out of his cage, he is led about by means of ropes to all the huts,
          accompanied by people armed with lances, bows, and arrows. At each
          hut the bear and bear-leaders are treated to something good to eat
          and drink. This goes on for several days until all the huts, not
          only in that village but also in the next, have been visited. The
          days are given up to sport and noisy jollity. Then the bear is tied
          to a tree or wooden pillar and shot to death by the arrows of the
          crowd, after which its flesh is roasted and eaten. Among the
          Orotchis of the Tundja River women take part in the bear-feasts,
          while among the Orotchis of the River Vi the women will not even
          touch bear's flesh.<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the treatment
          of the captive bear by these tribes there are features which can
          hardly be distinguished from worship. Such, for example, are the
          prayers offered to it both alive and dead; the offerings of food,
          including portions of its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg
          198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          own flesh, laid before the animal's skull; and the Gilyak custom of
          leading the living beast on to the ice of the river in order to
          ensure a supply of fish, and of conducting him from house to house
          in order that every family may receive his blessing, just as in
          Europe a May-tree or a personal representative of the tree-spirit
          used to be taken from door to door in spring for the sake of
          diffusing among all and sundry the fresh energies of reviving
          nature.<a id="noteref_580" name="noteref_580" href=
          "#note_580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a>
          Again, the solemn participation in his flesh and blood, and
          particularly the Aino custom of sharing the contents of the cup
          which had been consecrated by being set before the dead beast, are
          strongly suggestive of a sacrament, and the suggestion is confirmed
          by the Gilyak practice of reserving special vessels to hold the
          flesh and cooking it on a fire kindled by a sacred apparatus which
          is never employed except on these religious occasions. Indeed our
          principal authority on Aino religion, the Rev. John Batchelor,
          frankly describes as worship the ceremonious respect which the Aino
          pay to the bear,<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href=
          "#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> and
          he affirms that the animal is undoubtedly one of their gods.<a id=
          "noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a>
          Certainly the Aino appear to apply their name for god (<span lang=
          "ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kamui</span></span>) freely to the bear; but,
          as Mr. Batchelor himself points out,<a id="noteref_583" name=
          "noteref_583" href="#note_583"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">583</span></span></a> that
          word is used with many different shades of meaning and is applied
          to a great variety of objects, so that from its application to the
          bear we cannot safely argue that the animal is actually regarded as
          a deity. Indeed we are expressly told that the Aino of Saghalien do
          not consider the bear to be a god but only a messenger to the gods,
          and the message with which they charge the animal at its death
          bears out the statement.<a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584"
          href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a>
          Apparently the Gilyaks also look on the bear in the light of an
          envoy despatched with presents to the Lord of the Mountain, on whom
          the welfare of the people depends. At the same time they treat the
          animal as a being of a higher order than man, in fact as a minor
          deity, whose presence in the village, so long as he is kept and
          fed, diffuses blessings, especially by keeping at bay the swarms of
          evil spirits who are constantly lying in wait for <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> people, stealing their goods and
          destroying their bodies by sickness and disease. Moreover, by
          partaking of the flesh, blood, or broth of the bear, the Gilyaks,
          the Aino, and the Goldi are all of opinion that they acquire some
          portion of the animal's mighty powers, particularly his courage and
          strength. No wonder, therefore, that they should treat so great a
          benefactor with marks of the highest respect and affection.<a id=

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some light may
          be thrown on the ambiguous attitude of the Aino to bears by
          comparing the similar treatment which they accord to other
          creatures. For example, they regard the eagle-owl as a good deity
          who by his hooting warns men of threatened evil and defends them
          against it; hence he is loved, trusted, and devoutly worshipped as
          a divine mediator between men and the Creator. The various names
          applied to him are significant both of his divinity and of his
          mediatorship. Whenever an opportunity offers, one of these divine
          birds is captured and kept in a cage, where he is greeted with the
          endearing titles of <span class="tei tei-q">“Beloved god”</span>
          and <span class="tei tei-q">“Dear little divinity.”</span>
          Nevertheless the time comes when the dear little divinity is
          throttled and sent away in his capacity of mediator to take a
          message to the superior gods or to the Creator himself. The
          following is the form of prayer addressed to the eagle-owl when it
          is about to be sacrificed: <span class="tei tei-q">“Beloved deity,
          we have brought you up because we loved you, and now we are about
          to send you to your father. We herewith offer you food, <span lang=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the Aino
          hopes to profit in various ways by slaughtering the creatures,
          which, nevertheless, he treats as divine. He expects them to carry
          messages for him to their kindred or to the gods in the upper

          their bodies or in other ways; and apparently he looks forward to
          their bodily resurrection in this world, which will enable him
          again to catch and kill them, and again to reap all the benefits
          which he has already derived from their slaughter. For in the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus among the
          benefits which the Aino anticipates from the slaughter of the
          worshipful animals not the least substantial is that of gorging
          himself on their flesh and blood, both on the present and on many a
          similar occasion hereafter; and that pleasing prospect again is
          derived from his firm faith in the spiritual immortality and bodily
          resurrection of the dead animals. A like faith is shared by many
          savage hunters in many parts of the world and has given rise to a
          variety of quaint customs, some of which will be described
          presently. Meantime it is not unimportant to observe that the
          solemn festivals at which the Aino, the Gilyaks, and other tribes
          slaughter the tame caged bears with demonstrations of respect and
          sorrow, are probably nothing but an extension or glorification of
          similar rites which the hunter performs over any wild bear which he
          chances to kill in the forest. Indeed with regard to the Gilyaks we
          are expressly informed that this is the case. If we would
          understand the meaning of the Gilyak ritual, says Mr. Sternberg,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“we must above all remember that the
          bear-festivals are not, as is usually but <span class="tei tei-pb"

          killing of a house-bear but are held on every occasion when a
          Gilyak succeeds in slaughtering a bear in the chase. It is true
          that in such cases the festival assumes less imposing dimensions,
          but in its essence it remains the same. When the head and skin of a
          bear killed in the forest are brought into the village, they are
          accorded a triumphal reception with music and solemn ceremonial.
          The head is laid on a consecrated scaffold, fed, and treated with
          offerings, just as at the killing of a house-bear; and the guests
          of honour (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Narch-en</span></span>) are also assembled.
          So, too, dogs are sacrificed, and the bones of the bear are
          preserved in the same place and with the same marks of respect as
          the bones of a house-bear. Hence the great winter festival is only
          an extension of the rite which is observed at the slaughter of
          every bear.”</span><a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href=

          apparent contradiction in the practice of these tribes, who
          venerate and almost deify the animals which they habitually hunt,
          kill, and eat, is not so flagrant as at first sight it appears to
          us: the people have reasons, and some very practical reasons, for
          acting as they do. For the savage is by no means so illogical and
          unpractical as to superficial observers he is apt to seem; he has
          thought deeply on the questions which immediately concern him, he
          reasons about them, and though his conclusions often diverge very
          widely from ours, we ought not to deny him the credit of patient
          and prolonged meditation on some fundamental problems of human
          existence. In the present case, if he treats bears in general as
          creatures wholly subservient to human needs and yet singles out
          certain individuals of the species for homage which almost amounts
          to deification, we must not hastily set him down as irrational and
          inconsistent, but must endeavour to place ourselves at his point of
          view, to see things as he sees them, and to divest ourselves of the
          prepossessions which tinge so deeply our own views of the world. If
          we do so, we shall probably discover that, however absurd his
          conduct may appear to us, the savage nevertheless generally acts on
          a train of reasoning which seems to him in harmony with the

          experience. This I propose to illustrate in the following chapter,
          where I shall attempt to shew that the solemn ceremonial of the
          bear-festival among the Ainos and other tribes of north-eastern
          Asia is only a particularly striking example of the respect which
          on the principles of his rude philosophy the savage habitually pays

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The explanation of
        life by the theory of an indwelling and practically immortal soul is
        one which the savage does not confine to human beings but extends to
        the animate creation in general. In so doing he is more liberal and
        perhaps more logical than the civilised man, who commonly denies to
        animals that privilege of immortality which he claims for himself.
        The savage is not so proud; he commonly believes that animals are
        endowed with feelings and intelligence like those of men, and that,
        like men, they possess souls which survive the death of their bodies
        either to wander about as disembodied spirits or to be born again in
        animal form. Thus, for example, we are told that the Indian of Guiana
        does not see <span class="tei tei-q">“any sharp line of distinction,
        such as we see, between man and other animals, between one kind of
        animal and another, or between animals—man included—and inanimate
        objects. On the contrary, to the Indian, all objects, animate and
        inanimate, seem exactly of the same nature except that they differ in
        the accident of bodily form. Every object in the whole world is a
        being, consisting of a body and spirit, and differs from every other
        object in no respect except that of bodily form, and in the greater
        or less degree of brute power and brute cunning consequent on the

        Similarly we read that <span class="tei tei-q">“in Cherokee
        mythology, as in that of Indian tribes generally, there is no
        essential difference between men and animals. In the primal genesis
        period they seem to be completely undifferentiated, and we
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205"
        id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> find all creatures alike
        living and working together in harmony and mutual helpfulness until
        man, by his aggressiveness and disregard for the rights of the
        others, provokes their hostility, when insects, birds, fishes,
        reptiles, and fourfooted beasts join forces against him. Henceforth
        their lives are apart, but the difference is always one of degree
        only. The animals, like the people, are organized into tribes and
        have like them their chiefs and townhouses, their councils and
        ballplays, and the same hereafter in the Darkening land of Usunhiyi.
        Man is still the paramount power, and hunts and slaughters the others
        as his own necessities compel, but is obliged to satisfy the animal
        tribes in every instance, very much as a murder is compounded for,
        according to the Indian system, by <span class="tei tei-q">‘covering
        the bones of the dead’</span> with presents for the bereaved
        relatives.”</span><a id="noteref_594" name="noteref_594" href=

        same effect another observer of the North American Indians writes:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I have often reflected on the curious
        connexion which appears to subsist in the mind of an Indian between
        man and the brute creation, and found much matter in it for curious
        observation. Although they consider themselves superior to all other
        animals and are very proud of that superiority; although they believe
        that the beasts of the forest, the birds of the air, and the fishes
        of the waters, were created by the Almighty Being for the use of man;
        yet it seems as if they ascribe the difference between themselves and
        the brute kind, and the dominion which they have over them, more to
        their superior bodily strength and dexterity than to their immortal
        souls. All beings endowed by the Creator with the power of volition
        and self-motion, they view in a manner as a great society of which
        they are the head, whom they are appointed, indeed, to govern, but
        between whom and themselves intimate ties of connexion and
        relationship may exist, or at least did exist in the beginning of
        time. They are, in fact, according to their opinions, only the first
        among equals, the legitimate hereditary sovereigns of the whole
        animated race, of which they are themselves a constituent part.
        Hence, in their languages, those inflections of their nouns which we
        call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">genders</span></em>, are not, as with us,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206"

        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">feminine</span></em> species, but of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inanimate</span></em>
        kinds. Indeed, they go so far as to include trees and plants within
        the first of these descriptions. All animated nature, in whatever
        degree, is in their eyes a great whole, from which they have not yet
        ventured to separate themselves. They do not exclude other animals
        from their world of spirits, the place to which they expect to go
        after death.”</span><a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href=

        Cassowary man went forth to reap laurels on the field of battle, he
        used to reflect with satisfaction on the length of his lower limbs:

        Indians believe that between a man and the creature which is his
        guardian spirit there subsists so close a bond that the man acquires
        the powers and qualities, the virtues and defects of the animal. Thus
        if a man has seen a bear in that vision at puberty which determines
        an Indian's guardian spirit, he will be apt to be wounded in battle,
        because the bear is a slow and clumsy animal and easily trapped. If
        he has dreamed of an eagle, he will be able to see into the future
        and foretell coming events, because the eagle's vision is keen and
        piercing.<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href=

        Similarly, the Thompson Indians of British Columbia imagined that
        every man partook of the nature of the animal which was his guardian
        spirit; for example, a man who had the grisly bear for his protector
        would prove a much fiercer warrior than one who had only a crow, a
        coyote, or a fox for his guardian spirit. And before they set out on
        the war-path these Indians used to perform a mimic battle, in which
        each man, tricked out with paint and feathers, imitated the sounds of
        the animal that was his guardian spirit, grunting and whooping in
        character.<a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603" href=

        red plumage which live in the Brazilian forest. It is not merely that
        their souls will pass into these birds at death, but they themselves
        are actually identical with them in their life, and accordingly they
        treat the parrots as they might treat their fellow-tribesmen, keeping
        them in captivity, refusing to eat their flesh, and mourning for them
        when they die. However, they kill the wild birds for their feathers,
        and, though they will not kill, they pluck the tame ones to deck
        their own naked brown bodies with the gaudy plumage of their

        wear a very different aspect from that which the same act presents to
        us, who regard the intelligence of animals as far inferior to our own
        and deny them the possession of immortal souls. Hence on the

        whom he considers as knit together, like men, by the ties of kin and
        the obligations of the blood feud, and therefore as bound to resent
        the injury done to one of their number. Accordingly the savage makes
        it a rule to spare the life of those animals which he has no pressing
        motive for killing, at least such fierce and dangerous animals as are
        likely to exact a bloody vengeance for the slaughter of one of their
        kind. Crocodiles are animals of this sort. They are only found in hot
        countries, where, as a rule, food is abundant and primitive man has
        therefore little reason to kill them for the sake of their tough and
        unpalatable flesh.<a id="noteref_605" name="noteref_605" href=

        them in obedience to the law of blood feud, that is, as a retaliation
        for the slaughter of men by crocodiles. For example, the Dyaks of
        Borneo will not kill a crocodile unless a crocodile has first killed
        a man. <span class="tei tei-q">“For why, say they, should they commit
        an act of aggression, when he and his kindred can so easily repay
        them? But should the alligator take a human life, revenge becomes a
        sacred duty of the living relatives, who will trap the man-eater in
        the spirit of an officer of justice pursuing a criminal. Others, even
        then, hang back, reluctant to embroil themselves in a quarrel which
        does not concern them. The man-eating alligator is supposed to be
        pursued by a righteous Nemesis; and whenever one is caught they have
        a profound conviction that it must be the guilty one, or his

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a Dyak has
        made up his mind to take vengeance on the crocodiles for the death of
        a kinsman, he calls in the help of a Pangareran, a man whose business
        it is to charm and catch crocodiles and to make them do his will.
        While he is engaged in the discharge of his professional <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> duties the crocodile-catcher has to
        observe a number of odd rules. He may not go to anybody and may not
        even pass in front of a window, because he is unclean. He may not
        himself cook anything nor come near a fire. If he would eat fruit, he
        may not peel or husk it himself, but must get others to do it for
        him. He may not even chew his food, but is obliged to swallow it
        unchewed. A little hut is made for him on the bank of the river,
        where he uses divination by means of the figure of a crocodile drawn
        on a piece of bamboo for the purpose of determining whether his
        undertaking will prosper. The boat in which he embarks to catch the
        wicked man-eating crocodile must be painted yellow and red, and in
        the middle of it lances are erected with the points upward. Then the
        man of skill casts lots to discover whether the hook is to be baited
        with pork, or venison, or the flesh of a dog or an ass. In throwing
        the baited hook into the water he calls out: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ye crocodiles who are up stream, come down; and ye
        crocodiles who are down stream, come up; for I will give you all good
        food, as sweet as sugar and as fat as coco-nut. I will give you a
        pretty and beautiful necklace. When you have got it, keep it in your
        neck and body, for this food is very <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">pahuni</span></span>,”</span> which means that
        it would be sinful not to eat it. If a crocodile bites at the hook,
        the crocodile-catcher bawls out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Choose a
        place for yourself where you will lie; for many men are come to see
        you. They are come joyfully and exultingly, and they give you a
        knife, a lance, and a shroud.”</span> If the crocodile is a female,
        he addresses her as <span class="tei tei-q">“Princess”</span>; if it
        is a male, he calls it <span class="tei tei-q">“Prince.”</span> The
        enchanter, who is generally a cunning Malay, must continue his
        operations till he catches a crocodile in which traces are to be
        found shewing that the animal has indeed devoured a human being. Then
        the death of the man is atoned for, and in order not to offend the
        water-spirits a cat is sacrificed to the crocodiles. The heads of the
        dead crocodiles are fastened on stakes beside the river, where in
        time they bleach white and stand out sharply against the green
        background of the forest.<a id="noteref_607" name="noteref_607" href=

        the captured crocodile is being hauled in to the bank, the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211"
        id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> subtle Dyaks speak softly to
        him and beguile him into offering no resistance; but once they have
        him fast, with arms and legs securely pinioned, they howl at him and
        deride him for his credulity, while they rip up the belly of the
        infuriated and struggling brute to find the evidence of his guilt in
        the shape of human remains. On one occasion Rajah Brooke of Sarawak
        was present at a discussion among a party of Dyaks as to how they
        ought to treat a captured crocodile. One side maintained that it was
        proper to bestow all praise and honour on the kingly beast, since he
        was himself a rajah among animals and was now brought there to meet
        the rajah; in short, they held that praise and flattery were
        agreeable to him and would put him on his best behaviour. The other
        side fully admitted that on this occasion rajah met rajah; yet with
        prudent foresight they pointed to the dangerous consequences which
        might flow from establishing a precedent such as their adversaries
        contended for. If once a captured crocodile, said they, were praised
        and honoured, the other crocodiles, on hearing of it, would be puffed
        up with pride and ambition, and being seized with a desire to emulate
        the glory of their fellow would enter on a career of man-eating as
        the road likely to lead them by the shortest cut to the temple of
        fame.<a id="noteref_608" name="noteref_608" href=

        of Sumatra have also a great respect for crocodiles. Their celebrated
        law-giver Katoemanggoengan was indeed born again in the form of a
        crocodile; and thus his descendants, including the rajah of
        Indrapoera and his family, are more or less distant cousins of the
        crocodiles, and enjoy the help and protection of the creatures in
        many ways, for example when they go on a journey. The respect
        entertained for the animals is also attested by the ceremonies
        observed in some places when a crocodile has been caught. A crowd of
        women then performs certain dances which closely resemble the dances
        performed when somebody has died. Moreover, it is a rule with the

        the crocodiles the leavings of your food, and they would very

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Malays
        of Patani Bay, in Siam, there is a family whose members may not kill
        a crocodile nor even be present when one of these ferocious reptiles
        is captured. The reason alleged for this forbearance is that the
        family claim kindred with a woman named Betimor, who was drowned in
        the river and afterwards turned into a crocodile. After her
        transformation she appeared to her father in a dream and told him
        what had become of her; so he went down to the river and made
        offerings to her of rice and wax tapers. There is a shrine on the
        spot where the woman was transformed into a crocodile, and any one
        may dedicate offerings there and pray to Toh Sri Lam; for so she has
        been called ever since her metamorphosis. Members of the crocodile
        family call on her for help in sickness and other misfortunes, and
        they will do so on behalf of other people for a proper consideration.
        Rice and wax tapers are the usual offerings.<a id="noteref_610" name=

        islands of the Indian Archipelago, including Java, Sumatra, Celebes,
        Timor, and Ceram, this belief in a kinship of men with crocodiles
        assumes a peculiar form. The people imagine that women are often
        delivered of a child and a crocodile at the same birth, and that when
        this happens, the midwife carries the crocodile twin carefully down
        to the river and places it in the water. The family in which such a
        birth is thought to have happened, constantly put victuals into the
        river for their amphibious relation; and in particular the human
        twin, so long as he lives, goes down to the river at stated seasons
        to do his duty by his crocodile brother or sister; and if he were to
        fail to do so, it is the universal opinion <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> that he would be visited with sickness or death
        for his unnatural conduct. Large parties of these crocodile people
        periodically go out in a boat furnished with great plenty of
        provisions and all kinds of music, and they row backwards and
        forwards, with the music playing, in places where crocodiles do most
        abound. As they do so they sing and weep by turns, each of them
        invoking his animal kinsfolk, till the snout of one of the brutes
        bobbs up from the water, whereupon the music stops, and food, betel,
        and tobacco are thrown into the river. By these delicate attentions
        they hope to recommend themselves to the formidable creatures.<a id=

        about the island of Damba in the Victoria Nyanza were sacred and
        might not be molested in any way. Hence they multiplied and became
        dangerous; people made offerings to them in the hope of being spared
        by the monsters when they crossed in the ferries. From time to time
        batches of men were brought down to the beach and sacrificed to the
        crocodiles. Their arms and legs were broken so that they could not
        stir from the spot; then they were laid out in a row on the shore,
        and the crocodiles came and dragged them into the water. On the
        island there was a temple dedicated to the crocodiles, and here an
        inspired medium resided who gave oracular responses. Under the
        influence of the spirit he wagged his head from side to side, opening
        his jaws and snapping them together, just as a crocodile does.<a id=

        and serpents, and in that state of exaltation they uttered oracles,
        roaring like a lion, growling like a leopard, or grovelling and

        should so far forget himself as to devour one of his human kinsfolk,
        the chief of the tribe, or in his absence an old man familiar with
        the tribal customs, repairs at the head of the people to the edge of
        the water, and summons the family of the culprit to deliver him up to
        the arm of justice. A hook is then baited and cast into the river or
        lake. Next day the guilty brother, or one of his family, is dragged
        ashore, and after his crime has been clearly brought home to him by a
        strict interrogation, he is sentenced to death and executed. The

        Malagasy, indeed, regard the crocodile with superstitious veneration
        as the king of the waters and supreme in his own element. When they
        are about to cross a river they pronounce a solemn oath, or enter
        into an engagement to acknowledge his sovereignty over the waters. An
        aged native has been known to covenant with the crocodiles for nearly
        half an hour before plunging into the stream. After that he lifted up
        his voice and addressed the animal, urging him to do him no harm,
        since he had never hurt the crocodile; assuring him that he had never
        made war on any of his fellows, but on the contrary had always
        entertained the highest veneration for him; and adding that if he
        wantonly attacked him, vengeance would follow sooner or later; while
        if the crocodile devoured him, his relations and all his race would
        declare war against the beast. This harangue occupied another quarter
        of an hour, after which the orator dashed fearlessly into the
        stream.<a id="noteref_618" name="noteref_618" href=

        Again, persons journeying by night will not walk one behind the
        other, nor keep looking about them, for the tiger would think that
        this betrayed fear of him, and his feelings would be hurt by the
        suspicion. Neither will they travel bareheaded, for that also would
        be disrespectful to the tiger; nor will they knock off the glowing
        end of a firebrand, for the flying sparks are like the tiger's
        glistering eyes, and he would treat this as an attempt to mimic
        him.<a id="noteref_620" name="noteref_620" href=

        population of Mandeling, a district on the west coast of Sumatra, is
        divided into clans, one of which claims to be descended from a tiger.
        It is believed that the animal will not attack or rend the members of
        this clan, because they are his kinsmen. When members of the clan
        come upon the tracks of a tiger, they enclose them with three little
        sticks as a mark of homage; and when a tiger has been shot, the women
        of the clan are bound to offer betel to the dead beast.<a id=

        Battas of Sumatra seldom kill a tiger except from motives of revenge,
        observing the rule an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, or, as
        they express it, <span class="tei tei-q">“He who owes gold must pay
        in gold; he who owes breath (that is, life) must pay with
        breath.”</span> Nor can the beast be attacked without some ceremony;
        only weapons that have proved themselves able to kill may be used for
        the purpose. When the tiger has been killed, they bring the carcase
        to the village, set offerings before it, and burn incense over it,
        praying the spirit of the tiger to quit its material envelope and
        enter the incense pot. As soon as the soul may be supposed to have
        complied with this request, a speaker explains to the spirits in
        general the reasons for killing the tiger, and begs them to set forth
        these reasons to the departed soul of the beast, lest the latter
        should be angry and the people should suffer in consequence. Then
        they dance round the dead body of the tiger till they can dance no
        longer, after which they skin the carcase and <span class=

        inhabitants of the hills near Rajamahall, in Bengal, believe that if
        any man kills a tiger without divine orders, either he or one of his
        relations will be devoured by a tiger. Hence they are very averse to
        killing a tiger, unless one of their kinsfolk has been carried off by
        one of the beasts. In that case they go out for the purpose of
        hunting and slaying a tiger; and when they have succeeded they lay
        their bows and arrows on the carcase and invoke God, declaring that
        they slew the animal in retaliation for the loss of a kinsman.
        Vengeance having been thus taken, they swear not to attack another
        tiger except under similar provocation.<a id="noteref_623" name=

        natives of Cochin China have a great respect for the tiger, whom they
        regard as a terrible divinity. Yet they set traps for him and leave

        their excuses and condolences for the painful position in which he

        after the Iowas began to build their village near the mouth of Wolf

        repaired to the spot, and finding the snake made it presents of
        tobacco and other things which he had brought with him for the

        Delaware Indians also paid great respect to the rattlesnake, whom
        they called their grandfather, and they would on no account destroy
        one of the reptiles. They said that the rattlesnake guarded them and
        gave them notice of impending danger by his rattle, and that if they
        were to kill a rattlesnake, the rest of the species would soon hear
        of it and bite the Indians in revenge.<a id="noteref_628" name=

        obtain a rattle would have no hesitation in killing one of the snakes
        for the purpose; but he apologised profusely to the creature for the
        liberty he took with it, explaining that he required the rattle for
        the adornment of his person, and that no disrespect was intended to
        the snake; and in proof of his good will he would leave a piece of
        tobacco beside the carcase.<a id="noteref_629" name="noteref_629"

        Cherokee regard the rattlesnake as the chief of the snake tribe and
        fear and respect him accordingly. Few Cherokee will venture to kill a
        rattlesnake, unless they cannot help it, and even then they must
        atone for the crime by craving pardon of the snake's ghost either in
        their own person or through the mediation of a priest, according to a
        set formula. If these precautions are neglected, the kinsfolk of the
        dead snake will send one of their number as an avenger of blood, who
        will track down the murderer and sting him to death. It is absolutely
        necessary to cut off the snake's head and bury it deep in the earth
        and to hide the body in a hollow log; for if the remains were exposed
        to the weather, the other snakes would be so angry that they would
        send torrents of rain and all the streams would overflow their banks.
        If a Cherokee dreams of being bitten by a snake, <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he must be treated in exactly the same
        way as if he had been really bitten; for they think that he has
        actually been bitten by the ghost of a snake, and that if the proper
        remedies were not applied to the hurt, the place would swell and
        ulcerate, though possibly not for years afterwards.<a id=

        when an Englishman attempted to kill a rattlesnake, a party of

        grandfather, smoking over it, and beseeching it to take care of their
        families in their absence, and to open the heart of the British Agent
        so that he should fill their canoe with rum. A storm which overtook
        them next day on Lake Huron was attributed by them to the wrath of
        the insulted rattlesnake, and they sought to mollify him by throwing
        dogs as sacrifices to him into the waves.<a id="noteref_631" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Kiziba, a
        district of Central Africa, to the west of Lake Victoria Nyanza, if a
        woman accidentally kills a snake with her hoe while she is working in
        the field, she hastens in great agitation to the snake-priest and
        hands him over the hoe, together with two strings of cowries and an
        ox-hide, begging him to appease the angry spirit of the slain
        serpent. In this application she is accompanied and supported by all
        the villagers, who share her fears and anxiety. Accordingly the
        priest beats his drum as a sign that no woman of the village is to
        work in the fields till further notice. Next he wraps the dead
        serpent in a piece of the ox-hide and buries it solemnly. On the
        following day he performs a ceremony of purification for the
        slaughter of the reptile. He compounds a medicine out of the guts of
        a leopard or hyaena and earth or mud dissolved in water, and with
        this mixture he disinfects all the houses in the village, beginning
        with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name=
        "Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the house of the woman
        who killed the serpent. Next he proceeds to the fields, where all the
        women of the village have collected their hoes. These he purifies by
        dipping them in the fluid and then twirling them about so as to make
        the drops of water fly off. From that moment the danger incurred by
        the slaughter of the reptile is averted. The spirit of the serpent is
        appeased, and the women may resume their usual labours in the
        fields.<a id="noteref_633" name="noteref_633" href=

        that they cover the carcase with a blanket and bury it. A bow or gun

        done would be quite useless for the future, unless it were cleaned
        and exorcised by a medicine-man. However, certain persons who know
        the proper rites of atonement for such a crime can kill wolves with
        impunity, and they are sometimes hired to do so by people who have

        it in grass, and present it with a variety of trifles. Then he would
        lay the blame of the bear's death on the Russians, and bid the beast
        wreak his wrath upon them. Also he would ask the bear to inform the
        other bears how well he had been treated, that they too might come
        without fear. Seals, sea-lions, and other animals were treated by the
        Kamtchatkans with the same ceremonious respect. Moreover, they used
        to insert sprigs of a plant resembling bear's wort in the mouths of
        the animals they killed; after which they would exhort the grinning
        skulls to have no fear but to go and tell it to their fellows, that
        they also might come and be caught and so partake of this splendid
        hospitality.<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href=

        the Ostiaks have hunted and killed a bear, they cut off its head and
        hang it on a tree. Then they gather round in a circle and pay it
        divine honours. Next they run towards the carcase uttering
        lamentations and saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who killed you? It
        was the Russians. Who cut off your head? It was a Russian axe. Who
        skinned you? It was a knife made by a Russian.”</span> They explain,
        too, that the feathers which sped the arrow on its flight came from
        the wing of a strange bird, and that they did nothing but let the
        arrow go. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg
        223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        They do all this because they believe that the wandering ghost of the
        slain bear would attack them on the first opportunity, if they did
        not thus appease it.<a id="noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href=

        stuff the skin of the slain bear with hay; and after celebrating

        dress one of themselves in the skin. Then they dance round the
        skin-clad man, saying that it was not they who killed the animal, but
        some one else, generally a Russian. When they kill a fox they skin
        it, wrap the body in grass, and bid him go tell his companions how
        hospitably he has been received, and how he has received a new cloak
        instead of his old one.<a id="noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href=

        fuller account of the Koryak ceremonies is given by a more recent
        writer. He tells us that when a dead bear is brought to the house,
        the women come out to meet it dancing with firebrands. The bear-skin
        is taken off along with the head; and one of the women puts on the
        skin, dances in it, and entreats the bear not to be angry, but to be
        kind to the people. At the same time they offer meat on a wooden
        platter to the dead beast, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Eat,
        friend.”</span> Afterwards a ceremony is performed for the purpose of
        sending the dead bear, or rather his spirit, away back to his home.
        He is provided with provisions for the journey in the shape of
        puddings or reindeer-flesh packed in a grass bag. His skin is stuffed
        with grass and carried round the house, after which he is supposed to
        depart towards the rising sun. The intention of the ceremonies is to
        protect the people from the wrath of the slain bear and his kinsfolk,
        and so to ensure success in future bear-hunts.<a id="noteref_646"

        moreover, they held a funeral festival in his honour, at the close of
        which bards expatiated on the homage that had been paid to him,
        urging him to report to the other bears the high consideration with
        which he had been treated, in order that they also, following his

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reverence of
        hunters for the bear whom they regularly kill and eat may thus be
        traced all along the northern region of the Old World, from Bering's
        Straits to Lappland. It reappears in similar forms in North America.
        With the American Indians a bear hunt was an important event for
        which they prepared by long fasts and purgations. Before setting out
        they offered expiatory sacrifices to the souls of bears slain in
        previous hunts, and besought them to be favourable to the hunters.
        When a bear was killed the hunter lit his pipe, and putting the mouth
        of it between the bear's lips, blew into the bowl, filling the
        beast's mouth with smoke. Then he begged the bear not to be angry at
        having been killed, and not to thwart him afterwards in the chase.
        The carcase was roasted whole and eaten; not a morsel of the flesh
        might be left over. The head, painted red and blue, was hung on a
        post and addressed by orators, who heaped praise on the dead
        beast.<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href=

        the Nootka Indians of British Columbia, when a bear had been killed,
        it was brought in and seated before the head chief in an upright
        posture, with a chief's bonnet, wrought in figures, on its head, and
        its fur powdered over with white down. A tray of provisions was then
        set before it, and it was invited by words and gestures to eat. After
        that the animal was skinned, boiled, and eaten.<a id="noteref_652"

        Assiniboins pray to the bear and offer sacrifices to it of tobacco,
        belts, and other valuable objects. Moreover, they hold feasts in its
        honour, that they may win the beast's favour and live safe and sound.
        The bear's head is often kept in camp for several days mounted in
        some suitable position and decked with scraps of scarlet cloth,
        necklaces, collars, and coloured feathers. They offer the pipe to it,
        and pray that they may be able to kill all the bears they meet,
        without harm to themselves, for the purpose of anointing themselves
        with his fine grease and banqueting on his tender flesh.<a id=

        trader of the eighteenth century has described the endearments which
        a party of Ojibways lavished on a she-bear which he had just killed.
        They took her head in their hands, stroked it and kissed it, and
        begged a thousand pardons for her violent death; they called her
        their relation and grandmother, and begged her not to lay the fault
        at their door, for indeed it was an Englishman who had killed
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226"
        id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> her. Having severed the head
        from the body, they adorned it with all the trinkets they could
        muster and set it up on a scaffold in the lodge. Next day pipes were
        lit and tobacco smoke blown into the nostrils of the dead bear, and
        the trader was invited to pay this mark of respect to the animal as
        an atonement for having taken her life. Before they feasted on the
        bear's flesh, an orator made a speech in which he deplored the sad
        necessity under which they laboured of destroying their friends the
        bears; for how otherwise could they subsist?<a id="noteref_655" name=

        the Indians of the Queen Charlotte Islands, off the north-western
        coast of America, used to mark the skins of bears, otters, and other
        animals with four red crosses in a line, by way of propitiating the
        spirit of the beast they had killed.<a id="noteref_656" name=

        the Thompson Indians of British Columbia were about to hunt bears,
        they would sometimes address the animal and ask it to come and be
        shot. They prayed the grisly bear not to be angry with the hunter,
        nor to fight him, but rather to have pity on him and to deliver
        himself up to his mercies. The man who intended to hunt the grisly
        bear had to be chaste for some time before he set out on his
        dangerous adventure. When he had killed a bear, he and his companions
        painted their faces in alternate perpendicular stripes of black and
        red, and sang the bear song. Sometimes the hunter also prayed,
        thanking the beast for letting itself be killed so easily, and
        begging that its mate might share the same fate. After they had eaten
        the flesh of the bear's head, they tied the skull to the top of a
        small tree, as high as they could reach, and left it there. Having
        done so, they painted their faces with alternate stripes of red and
        black as before; for if they failed to observe this ceremony, the
        bears would be offended, and the hunters would not be able to kill
        any more. To place the heads of bears or any large beasts on trees or
        stones was a mark of respect to the animals.<a id="noteref_657" name=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“hunters who had killed buffaloes, leopards,
        or wild black swine observed in Agome for nine days the same, or very
        similar, ceremonies as are customary at the death of a woman, in
        order to prevent the soul of the slain beasts from avenging itself on
        them, a custom which is the less surprising because the mourning
        customs themselves are based on the fear of spirits, namely the
        spirits of the dead. The natives ascribe to the souls of these
        dangerous animals the power of killing the man who shot them, or of
        so blinding and enchanting him that in the chase he confuses animals
        and men and so incurs serious mishaps.”</span><a id="noteref_668"
        name="noteref_668" href="#note_668"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">668</span></span></a> The
        quaint ceremonies which these negroes observe for the purpose of
        avoiding the imaginary perils have been described by a German
        missionary. The leopard and the wild buffalo, he tells us, are
        believed to be animated by malignant souls which not only do the
        hunter a mischief while they still occupy the bodies of the living
        creatures, but even after death, in their disembodied state, continue
        to haunt and plague their slayer, sometimes egging on a serpent or a
        leopard to sting or bite him, sometimes blinding him so that he
        shoots a man for an animal, or cannot find his way home and goes
        groping about in the wilderness till he perishes miserably. If a man
        thus blinded and crazed should make his way back to the town, he is
        banished for life and sold into slavery; his house and plantation are
        razed to the ground; and his nearest relations are often given as
        bail into the hands of strangers. It is therefore a very serious
        matter indeed for a hunter to incur the wrath of a leopard's ghost,
        and it is quite natural that he should take all reasonable measures
        to guard himself against so threatening a calamity. Hence as soon as
        he has killed a leopard, he hurries back to the town and brings word
        of it to the other men who have slain leopards on former occasions,
        and who now assist him with their advice and experience. The first
        thing they do is to put a stalk of grass in his mouth as a sign that
        he may not speak. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg
        230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Then they repair to the place where the leopard lies dead in the
        forest, and inform the animal of the reasons why he has been shot,
        namely, because he has stolen sheep, fowls, and pigs, and has killed
        men. Next the drums are beaten and the people assemble in the open
        square of the town. The dead leopard meanwhile has been fastened to a
        pole, and with his eyes bandaged and his face upturned to heaven, is
        solemnly carried about the town and set down before the houses of the
        principal folk, who reward the hero and his comrades with presents.
        After the procession has gone the round, the leopard is tied to a
        tree, and the hunters paint the slayer with red and white so as to
        make him look like a leopard, except that the leopard's spots are
        only painted on the left side of his body; a basket painted in the
        same colours is clapped on his head, and magical strings of cowries
        are tied round his hands and feet. Thus attired, he and the other
        heroes who have killed leopards crawl about on all fours and roar
        like leopards when anybody comes near them. In his left hand every
        man grasps a bow for the slaughter of innocent cocks and hens, and
        with his right he grabbles about in the earth like an animal seeking
        what it may devour. None of them may speak, they may only roar, but
        they do that in a masterly manner. At the head of this imposing
        procession go two men armed with a thick cudgel and a spear
        respectively; and the rear is brought up by a third man, who is
        privileged to walk upright on his hind legs. This favoured person is
        the cook, whose office it is to dress the fowls which the human
        leopards; purloin in the course of their pilgrimage; indeed for
        nineteen days they are privileged, no doubt in their character of
        leopards, to rob the hen-roosts with impunity. In the afternoon the
        carcase of the leopard is taken down, skinned, and cut up. The
        titbits are sent to the chief and the other dignitaries, who eat
        them; and the remainder of the flesh is consumed by the common folk.
        The skin, the teeth, the head, and the claws belong to the hunter who
        killed the beast. But for nineteen days thereafter the slayer of the
        leopard must retain his peculiar costume: he may eat only
        warm-blooded animals and food seasoned with salt: he may not eat
        anything seasoned with pepper; and on no account <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> may he taste fish, because they are
        cold-blooded creatures. A general feast, of which all the male
        inhabitants of the town partake, winds up the proceedings at the
        close of the nineteen days. A feature of the festivities is a
        dramatic representation of a leopard-hunt, which is carried out in
        every detail amid great excitement. If only all these ceremonies are
        strictly observed, the hunter need have no fear at all of being
        plagued by the leopard's ghost.<a id="noteref_669" name="noteref_669"

        greatly fear the ghosts of buffaloes which they have killed, and they
        always appease these dangerous spirits. On no account will they bring
        the head of a slain buffalo into a village or into a garden of
        plantains: they always eat the flesh of the head in the open country.
        Afterwards they place the skull in a small hut built for the purpose,
        where they pour out beer as an offering and pray to the ghost to stay
        where he is and not to harm them.<a id="noteref_670" name=

        enough the Baganda also dread the ghosts of sheep, which they believe
        would haunt and kill the butcher if they saw him give the fatal
        stroke. Hence when a man is about to slaughter a sheep, he gets
        another man to divert its attention, and coming up behind the
        unsuspecting animal he stuns it with the blow of an axe-handle; then,
        before it can recover consciousness, he adroitly cuts its throat. In
        this way the ghost of the sheep is bamboozled and will not haunt the
        butcher. Moreover, when a sheep dies in a house, the housewife may
        not say bluntly to her husband, <span class="tei tei-q">“The sheep is
        dead,”</span> or its ghost, touched to the quick, would certainly
        make her fall ill and might even kill her. She must put a finer point
        on the painful truth by saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am unable
        to untie such and such a sheep.”</span> Her husband understands her,

        resent so delicate an allusion to its melancholy decease.<a id=

        beast whose life the savage hunter takes with joy, yet with fear and
        trembling, is the whale. After the slaughter of a whale the maritime
        Koryak of north-eastern Siberia hold a communal festival, the

        the following year; that it will induce its relatives to come along,
        telling them of the hospitable reception that has been accorded to
        it. According to the Koryak ideas, the whales, like all other
        animals, constitute one tribe, or rather family, of related
        individuals, who live in villages like the Koryak. They avenge the
        murder of one of their number, and are grateful for kindnesses that
        they may have received.”</span><a id="noteref_673" name="noteref_673"
        href="#note_673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">673</span></span></a> As
        large whales are now rarely seen in the bays of the Okhotsk Sea, the
        Koryak at the present time generally celebrate the festival for a
        white whale. One such festival was witnessed by Mr. W. Jochelson, at
        the village of Kuel, in October 1900. A white whale had been caught
        in the nets, and as the sea was partially frozen, the carcase had to
        be brought ashore in a sledge. When it was seen nearing the beach, a
        number of women, arrayed in their long embroidered dancing-coats,
        went forth to meet and welcome it, carrying lighted fire-brands in
        their hands. To carry burning fire-brands from the hearth is the
        ancient Koryak fashion of greeting an honoured guest. Strictly
        speaking, the women who go forth to welcome a whale to the house
        should wear masks of sedge-grass on their faces as well as
        dancing-coats on their bodies, and should carry sacrificial alder
        branches as well as firebrands <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> in their hands, but on the present occasion the
        women dispensed with the use of masks. They danced, shaking their
        heads, moving their shoulders, and swinging their whole bodies with
        arms outstretched, now squatting, now rising and singing,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! a guest has come.”</span> In spite of
        the cold and the wind the sweat dripped from them, so violently did
        they dance, and they sang and screamed till they were hoarse. When
        the sledge with its burden had reached the shore, one of the women
        pronounced an incantation over the whale's head, and then thrust
        alder branches and sacrificial grass into its mouth. Next they
        muffled its head in a hood, apparently to prevent the creature from
        witnessing the painful spectacle of its own dissection. After that
        the men cut up the carcase, and the women collected the blood in
        pails. Two seals, which had also been killed, were included in the
        festivities which followed. The heads of all three animals were cut
        off and placed on the roof of the house. Next day the festival began.
        In the morning the women plaited travelling bags of grass for the use
        of the whale, and made grass masks. In the evening, the people having
        assembled in a large underground house, some boiled pieces of the
        white whale were placed in a grass bag and set before a wooden image
        of a white whale, so that the animal, or its departed spirit, was
        thus apparently supposed to be regaled with portions of its own body;
        for the white whale and the seals were treated as honoured guests at
        the banquet. To keep up the pretence, the people were silent or spoke
        only in whispers for fear of wakening the guests before the time. At
        last the preparations were complete: fresh faggots piled on the
        hearth sent up a blaze, illumining with an unsteady light the
        smoke-blackened walls of the vast underground dwelling, which a
        moment before had been shrouded in darkness; and the long silence was
        broken by the joyful cries of the women, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Here dear guests have come!”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Visit us often!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“When
        you go back to the sea, tell your friends to call on us also, we will
        prepare just as nice food for them as for you.”</span> With these
        words they pointed to puddings set out temptingly on the boards. Next
        the host took a piece of the fat of the white whale and threw it into
        the fire, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are burning it in the
        fire for thee!”</span> Then he went to the domestic shrine,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234"
        id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> placed lumps of fat before the
        rude effigies of the guardian spirits, and smeared fat on their
        mouths. The appetites of the higher powers having thus been
        satisfied, the people set to and partook of the good things provided
        for them, including the flesh of the white whale and the seals.
        Lastly, two old men practised divination by means of the
        shoulder-blade of a seal to discover whether the white whale would go
        back to the sea and call his fellows to come and be caught like
        himself. In order to extract this information from the bone burning
        coals were piled on it, and the resulting cracks were carefully
        scrutinised. To the delight of all present the omens proved
        favourable: a long transverse crack indicated the sea to which the
        spirit of the white whale would soon depart. Four days later the
        departure actually took place. It was a bright sunshiny wintry
        morning: the frost was keen; and for more than a mile seaward the
        beach was covered with blocks of ice. In the great underground
        dwelling, where the feast had been held, the hearth had been turned
        into something like an altar. On it lay the heads of the white whale
        and the seals, and beside them travelling-bags of grass filled with
        puddings, which the souls of the animals were to take with them on
        their long journey. Beside the hearth knelt two women, their faces
        covered with grass masks and their heads bent over the bags, mumbling
        an incantation. The sunlight streamed down on them through the
        smoke-hole overhead, but spread only a dim twilight through the
        remoter recesses of the vast subterranean chamber. The masks worn by
        the women were intended to guard them against the spirit of the white
        whale, which was supposed to be hovering invisible in the air. The
        incantation over, the women rose from their knees and doffed their
        masks. A careful examination of a pudding, which had been offered in
        sacrifice to the white whale, now revealed the joyful intelligence
        that the spirit of the whale had accepted the sacrifice and was about
        to return to the sea. All that remained, therefore, to do was to
        speed him on his way. For that purpose two men ascended the roof, let
        down thongs through the smoke-hole, and hauled up the heads of the
        white whale and of the seals together with the travelling-bags of
        provisions. That concluded the despatch of the <span class=

        Teton Indian is on a journey and he meets a grey spider or a spider
        with yellow legs, he kills it, because some evil would befall him if
        he did not. But he is very careful not to let the spider know that he
        kills it, for if the spider knew, his soul would go and tell the
        other spiders, and one of them <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        Thompson Indians of British Columbia cherished many superstitious
        beliefs and observed many superstitious practices in regard to deer.
        When a deer was killed, they said that the rest of the deer would be
        well pleased if the hunters butchered the animal nicely and cleanly.
        To waste venison displeased the animals, who after that would not
        allow themselves to be shot by the hunter. If a hunter was
        overburdened and had to leave some of the venison behind, the other
        deer were better pleased if he hung it up on a tree than if he let it
        lie on the ground. The guts were gathered and put where the blood had
        been spilt in butchering the beast, and the whole was covered up with
        a few fir-boughs. In laying the boughs on the blood and guts the man
        told the deer not to grieve for the death of their friend and not to
        take it ill that he had left some of the body behind, for he had done
        his best to cover it. If he did not cover it, they thought the deer
        would be sorry or angry and would spoil his luck in the chase. When
        the head of a deer had to be left behind, they commonly placed it on
        the branch of a tree, that it might not be contaminated by dogs and
        women. For the same reason they burned the bones of the slain deer,
        lest they should be touched by women or gnawed by dogs. And venison
        was never brought into a hut by the common door, because that door
        was used by women; it was taken in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        hunter would give a deer's head to a man who was the first or second
        of a family, for that would make the rest of the deer very shy and
        hard to shoot. And in telling his friends of his bag he would
        generally call a buck a doe, and a doe he would call a fawn, and a
        fawn he would call a hare. This he did that he might not seem to the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lengua Indians
        of the Gran Chaco love to hunt the ostrich, but when they have killed
        one of these birds and are bringing home the carcase to the village,
        they take steps to outwit the resentful ghost of their victim. They
        think that when the first natural shock of death is passed, the ghost
        of the ostrich pulls himself together and makes after his body.
        Acting on this sage calculation, the Indians pluck feathers from the

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Esquimaux of
        the Hudson Bay region believe that the reindeer are controlled by a
        great spirit who resides in a large cave near the end of Cape
        Chidley. The outward form of the spirit is that of a huge white bear.
        He obtains and controls the spirit of every reindeer that is slain or
        dies, and it depends on his good will whether the people shall have a
        supply of reindeer or not. The sorcerer intercedes with this great
        spirit and prevails on him to send the deer to the hungry Esquimaux.
        He informs the spirit that the people have in no way offended him,
        since he, the sorcerer, has taken great care that the whole of the
        meat was eaten up, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg

        that last spring, when the does were returning to him to drop their
        young, none of the little or embryo fawns were devoured by the dogs.
        After long incantations the magician announces that the patron of the
        deer condescends to supply the Esquimaux with the spirits of the
        animals in a material form, and that soon there will be plenty in the
        land. He charges the people to fall on and slay and thereby win the
        approval of the spirit, who loves to see good folk enjoying
        themselves, knowing that so long as the Esquimaux refrain from
        feeding their dogs with the unborn young, the spirits of the dead
        reindeer will return again to his watchful care. The dogs are not
        allowed to taste the flesh, and until the supply is plentiful they
        may not gnaw the leg-bones, lest the guardian of the deer should take
        offence and send no more of the animals. If, unfortunately, a dog
        should get at the meat, a piece of his tail is cut off or his ear is
        cropped to let the blood flow.<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713"

        the Central Esquimaux hold that sea-mammals, particularly whales,
        ground-seals, and common seals, sprang from the severed fingers of
        the goddess Sedna, and that therefore an Esquimau must make atonement
        for every such animal that he kills. When a seal is brought into the
        hut, the woman must stop working till it has been cut up. After the
        capture of a ground seal, walrus, or whale they must rest for three
        days. Not all sorts of work, however, are forbidden, for they may
        mend articles made of sealskin, but they may not make anything new.
        For example, an old tent cover may be enlarged in order to build a
        larger hut, but it is not allowed to make a new one. Working on new
        deerskins is strictly forbidden. No skins of this kind obtained in
        summer may be prepared before the ice has formed and the first seal
        has been caught with the harpoon. Later on, as soon as the first
        walrus has been taken, the work must again stop until autumn comes
        round. Hence all families are eager to finish the work on deerskins
        as fast as possible, for until that is done the walrus season may not
        begin.<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href=

            may come to life again.</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Esquimaux
        about Bering Strait believe that the souls of dead sea-beasts, such
        as seals, walrus, and whales, remain attached to their bladders, and
        that by returning the bladders to the sea they can cause the souls to
        be reincarnated in fresh bodies and so multiply the game which the
        hunters pursue and kill. Acting on this belief every hunter carefully
        removes and preserves the bladders of all the sea-beasts that he
        kills; and at a solemn festival held once a year in winter these
        bladders, containing the souls of all the sea-beasts that have been
        killed throughout the year, are honoured with dances and offerings of
        food in the public assembly-room, after which they are taken out on
        the ice and thrust through holes into the water; for the simple
        Esquimaux imagine that the souls of the animals, in high good humour
        at the kind treatment they have experienced, will thereafter be born
        again as seals, walrus, and whales, and in that form will flock
        willingly to be again speared, harpooned, or otherwise done to death
        by the hunters. The ceremonies observed at these annual festivals of
        reincarnation are elaborate. The assembly-room or dancing-house
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kashim</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kassigit</span></span>), in which the festival
        is held, consists of a spacious semi-subterranean chamber entered by
        a tunnel, which leads down to a large round cellar under the floor of
        the house. From the cellar you ascend into the assembly-room through
        a hole in the floor. Wooden benches run round the apartment, which is
        lit by lamps. An opening in the roof serves at once as a window and a
        chimney. Unmarried men sleep in the assembly-room at all times; they
        have no other home. The festival is commonly held in December, but it
        may fall as late as January. It lasts several days. When the time is
        come <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name=
        "Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to celebrate it, each
        hunter brings into the assembly-room the inflated bladders of all the
        seals, walrus, and whales that he has killed during the year. These
        are tied by the necks in bunches and hung up on seal spears, which
        are stuck in a row in the wall some six or eight feet above the
        floor. Here food and water are offered to them, or rather to the
        spirits of the animals which are supposed to be present in the
        bladders; and the spirits signify their acceptance of the offering by
        causing the bladders to swing to and fro, a movement which is really
        produced by a man sitting in a dark corner, who pulls a string
        attached to the bladders. Further, the bladders are fumigated with
        torches of wild parsnip stalks, the aromatic smoke and red flames of
        which are believed to be well-pleasing to the souls of the animals
        dangling in the bladders. Moreover to amuse the souls men execute
        curious dances before them to the music of drums. First the dancers
        move slowly with a jerky action from side to side; then they gallop
        obliquely with arms tossed up and down; and lastly they hop and jump,
        always keeping perfect time to the beat of the drums. The dance is
        supposed to imitate the movements of seals and walrus; and again the
        spirits signify their pleasure by making the bladders swing backwards
        and forwards. During the continuance of the festival no loud noises
        may be made in the assembly-room for fear of alarming the souls of
        the animals in the bladders; if any person makes a noise by accident,
        all the men present raise a chorus of cries in imitation of the notes
        of the eider duck to let the souls of the animals think that the
        unseemly disturbance proceeds from the birds and not from the people.
        Further, so long as the festival lasts, no wood may be cut with an
        iron axe in the village, the men must keep rigidly apart from the
        women, and no female above the age of puberty may come near the
        bladders suspended in the assembly-room, the reason assigned being
        that such women are unclean and might offend the sensitive souls of
        the sea-beasts in the bladders. But immature girls, being untainted
        by the pollution which attaches to adult women, may go about the
        bladders freely. The last and crowning scene of the festival takes
        place at night or just at sunrise. The spears <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with the bladders attached to them are
        passed out by the shaman into the open air through the smoke-hole in
        the roof. When all are outside, a huge torch of wild parsnip stalks
        is lighted; the chief shaman takes it on his shoulder, and runs with
        it as fast as he can across the snow and out on the ice. Behind him
        troop all the men carrying each his spear with the bladders of the
        sea-beasts dangling and flapping from it; and in the rear race the
        women, children, and old men, howling, screaming and making a great
        uproar. In the darkness the lurid flame of the torch shoots high into
        the air, casting a red glare over the snowy landscape and lighting up
        the swarm of fantastic, fur-clad figures that stream along in wild
        excitement. Arrived at a hole, which had been cut on purpose in the
        sea-ice, the shaman plants his burning torch beside it in the snow,
        and every man as he comes up rips open his bladders and thrusts them,
        one after the other, into the water under the ice. This ends the
        ceremony. The souls of the dead seals, walrus, and whales, are now
        ready to be born again in the depths of the sea. So all the people
        return contented to the village. At St. Michael the men who have
        thrust the bladders under the ice are obliged on their return to leap
        through a fire of wild parsnip stalks, probably as a mode of
        ceremonial purification; for after the dance and the offering of food
        at the festival the chief shaman passes a lighted torch of parsnip
        stalks round the assembly-room and the dancers, for the express
        purpose of purifying them and averting any evil influence that might
        bring sickness or ill luck on the hunters.<a id="noteref_716" name=

        Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia think that when a salmon is
        killed its soul returns to the salmon country. Hence they take care
        to throw the bones and offal into the sea, in order that the soul may
        reanimate them at the resurrection of the salmon. Whereas if they
        burned the bones the soul would be lost, and so it would be quite
        impossible for that salmon to rise from the dead.<a id="noteref_718"

        manner the Otawa Indians of Canada, believing that the souls of dead
        fish passed into other bodies of fish, never burned fish bones, for
        fear of displeasing the souls of the fish, who would come no more to
        the nets.<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href=

        Hurons also refrained from throwing fish bones into the fire, lest
        the souls of the fish should go and warn the other fish not to let
        themselves be caught, since the Hurons would burn their bones.
        Moreover, they had men who preached to the fish and persuaded them to
        come and be caught. A good preacher was much sought after, for they
        thought that the exhortations of a clever man had a great effect in
        drawing the fish to the nets. In the Huron fishing village where the
        French missionary Sagard stayed, the preacher to the <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fish prided himself very much on his
        eloquence, which was of a florid order. Every evening after supper,
        having seen that all the people were in their places and that a
        strict silence was observed, he preached to the fish. His text was
        that the Hurons did not burn fish bones. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then enlarging on this theme with extraordinary unction,
        he exhorted and conjured and invited and implored the fish to come

        Scotch fishermen are persuaded that if blood be drawn in a quarrel on
        the coast where herring are being caught, the shoal will at once take
        its departure and not return for that season at least. West Highland
        fishermen believe that every shoal of herring has its leader which it
        follows wherever he goes. This leader is twice as big as an ordinary
        herring, and the fishermen call it the king of herring. When they
        chance to catch it in their nets they put it back carefully into the
        sea; for they would esteem it petty treason to destroy the royal
        fish.<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href=

        the Tarahumares of Mexico are preparing to poison the waters of a
        river for the purpose of stupefying and catching the fish, they take
        the precaution of first making offerings to the Master of the Fish by
        way of payment for the fish of which they are about to bereave him.
        The offerings consist of axes, hats, blankets, girdles, pouches, and
        especially knives and strings of beads, which are hung to a cross or
        a horizontal bar set up in the middle of the river. However, the
        Master of the Fish, who is thought to be the oldest fish, does not
        long enjoy these good things; for next morning the owners of the

        stringent are the precautions taken when the fish are the first of
        the season. On salmon rivers, when the fish begin to run up the
        stream in spring, they are received with much deference by tribes
        who, like the Indians of the Pacific Coast of North America, subsist
        largely upon a fish diet. To some of these tribes the salmon is what
        corn is to the European, rice to the Chinese, and seals to the
        Esquimaux. Plenty of salmon means abundance in the camp and joy at
        the domestic hearth; failure of the salmon for a single season means
        famine and desolation, silence in the village, and sad hearts about
        the fire.<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href=

        Accordingly in British Columbia the Indians used to go out to meet
        the first fish as they came up the river: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They paid court to them, and would address them thus:
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘You fish, you fish; you are all chiefs, you

        the Thlinkeet or Tlingit of Alaska the first halibut of the season is
        carefully handled and addressed as a chief, and a festival is given
        in his honour, after which the fishing goes on.<a id="noteref_733"

        the tribes of the Lower Fraser River when the first sockeye-salmon of
        the season has been caught, the fisherman carries it to the chief of
        his tribe, who delivers it to his wife. She prays, saying to the
        salmon, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who has brought you here to make us
        happy? We are thankful to your chief for sending you.”</span> When
        she has cut and roasted the salmon according to certain prescribed
        rules, the whole tribe is invited and partakes of the fish, after
        they have purified themselves by drinking a decoction of certain
        plants which is regarded as a medicine for cleansing the people. But
        widowers, widows, menstruous women, and youths may not eat of this
        particular salmon. Even later, when the fish have become plentiful
        and these ceremonies are dispensed with, the same classes of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254"
        id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> persons are not allowed to eat
        fresh salmon, though they may partake of the dried fish. The
        sockeye-salmon must always be looked after carefully. Its bones have
        to be thrown into the river, after which the fish will revive and
        return to its chief in the west. Whereas if the fish are not treated
        with consideration, they will take their revenge, and the careless
        fisherman will be unlucky.<a id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734"

        the Songish or Lkungen tribe of Vancouver Island it is a rule that on
        the day when the first salmon have been caught, the children must
        stand on the beach waiting for the boats to return. They stretch out
        their little arms and the salmon are heaped on them, the heads of the
        fish being always kept in the direction in which the salmon are
        swimming, else they would cease to run up the river. So the children
        carry them and lay them on a grassy place, carefully keeping the
        heads of the salmon turned in the same direction. Round the fish are
        placed four flat stones, on which the plant hog's wort (<span lang=
        "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Peucedanum leiocarpum</span></span>, Nutt.), red
        paint, and bulrushes are burnt as an offering to the salmon. When the
        salmon have been roasted each of the children receives one, which he
        or she is obliged to eat, leaving nothing over. But grown people are
        not allowed to eat the fish for several days. The bones of the salmon
        that the children have eaten may not touch the ground. They are kept
        in dishes, and on the fourth day an old woman, who pretends to be
        lame, gathers them in a huge basket and throws them into the
        sea.<a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735" href=

        Tsimshian Indians of British Columbia observe certain ceremonies when
        the first olachen fish of the season are caught. The fish are roasted
        on an instrument of elder-berry wood, and the man who roasts them
        must wear his travelling dress, mittens, cape, and so forth. While
        this is being done the Indians pray that plenty of olachen may come
        to their fishing-ground. The fire may not be blown up, and in eating
        the fish they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
        255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> may
        not cool it by blowing nor break a single bone. Everything must be
        neat and clean, and the rakes used for catching the fish must be kept
        hidden in the house.<a id="noteref_736" name="noteref_736" href=

        spring, when the winds blow soft from the south and the salmon begin
        to run up the Klamath river, the Karoks of California dance for
        salmon, to ensure a good catch. One of the Indians, called the Kareya
        or God-man, retires to the mountains and fasts for ten days. On his
        return the people flee, while he goes to the river, takes the first
        salmon of the catch, eats some of it, and with the rest kindles the
        sacred fire in the sweating-house. <span class="tei tei-q">“No Indian
        may take a salmon before this dance is held, nor for ten days after
        it, even if his family are starving.”</span> The Karoks also believe
        that a fisherman will take no salmon if the poles of which his
        spearing-booth is made were gathered on the river-side, where the
        salmon might have seen them. The poles must be brought from the top
        of the highest mountain. The fisherman will also labour in vain if he
        uses the same poles a second year in booths or weirs, <span class=

        allowed to be sold without the heart being first taken out, nor to be
        kept over night, but must be all consumed or eaten the day they are
        taken out of the water. All these rules are observed for about ten
        days.”</span><a id="noteref_738" name="noteref_738" href=

        think that if the heart of a fish were eaten by a stranger at the
        beginning of the season, they would catch no more fish. Hence, they

        May and June. They prepare for the fishing by observing rules of
        ceremonial purity, and when they have gone out to fish, the women at

        or the fish would hear them and disappear. When the first fish is
        caught he is brought home and passed through a small opening at the
        end of the hut, but not through the door; for if he were passed

        Yuracares Indians of Bolivia are at great pains to collect all the

        them in the fire, <span class="tei tei-q">“in order that the animals

        sacrificing an animal the Lapps regularly put aside the bones, eyes,
        ears, heart, lungs, sexual parts (if the animal was a male), and a
        morsel of flesh from each limb. Then, after eating the remainder of
        the flesh, they laid the bones and the rest in anatomical order in a
        coffin and buried them with the usual rites, believing that the god
        to whom the animal was sacrificed would reclothe the bones with flesh
        and restore the animal to life in Jabme-Aimo, the subterranean world
        of the dead. Sometimes, as after feasting on a bear, they seem to
        have contented themselves with thus burying the bones.<a id=

        the Lapps expected the resurrection of the slain animal to take place
        in another world, resembling in this respect the Kamtchatkans, who
        believed that every creature, down to the smallest fly, would rise

        belief in the resurrection of the animals, or on a fear of
        intimidating other creatures of the same species and offending the

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
        review of customs observed by savages for the conciliation and
        multiplication of animals which they hunt and kill, is fitted to
        impress us with a lively sense of the unquestioning faith which
        primitive man reposes in the immortality of the lower creatures. He
        appears to assume as an axiom too obvious to be disputed that beasts,
        birds, and fishes have souls like his own, which survive the death of
        their bodies and can be reborn in other bodies to be again killed and
        eaten by the hunter. The whole series of customs described in the
        foregoing pages—customs which are apt to strike the civilised reader
        as quaint and absurd—rests on this fundamental assumption. A
        consideration of them suggests a doubt whether the current
        explanation of the savage belief in human immortality is adequate to
        account for all the facts. That belief is commonly deduced from a
        primitive theory of dreams. The savage, it is said, fails to
        distinguish the visions of sleep from the realities of waking life,
        and accordingly when he has dreamed of his dead friends he
        necessarily concludes that they have not wholly perished, but that
        their spirits continue to exist in some place and some form, though
        in the ordinary course of events they elude the perceptions of his
        senses. On this theory the conceptions, whether gross or refined,
        whether repulsive or beautiful, which savages and perhaps civilised
        men have formed of the state of the departed, would seem to be no
        more than elaborate hypotheses constructed to account for appearances
        in dreams; these towering structures, for all their radiant or gloomy
        grandeur, for all the massy strength and solidity with which they
        present themselves to the imagination of many, may turn out on
        inspection to be mere visionary castles built of clouds and vapour,
        which a breath of reason suffices to melt into air.</p><span class=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even if we
        grant for the sake of argument that this theory offers a ready
        explanation of the widespread belief in human immortality, it is less
        easy to see how the theory accounts for the corresponding belief of
        so many races in the immortality of the lower animals. In his dreams
        the savage recognises the images of his departed friends by those
        familiar traits of feature, voice, and gesture which characterised
        them in life. But can we suppose that he recognises dead beasts,
        birds, and fishes in like manner? That their images come before him
        in sleep with all the particular features, the minute individual
        differences, which distinguished them in life from their fellows, so
        that when he sees them he can say to himself, for example,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the very tiger that I speared
        yesterday; his carcase is dead, but his spirit must be still
        alive”</span>; or, <span class="tei tei-q">“That is the very salmon I
        caught and ate this morning; I certainly killed his body but clearly
        I have not succeeded in destroying his soul”</span>? No doubt it is
        possible that the savage has arrived at his theory of animal
        immortality by some such process of reasoning, but the supposition
        seems at least more far-fetched and improbable than in the case of
        human immortality. And if we admit the insufficiency of the
        explanation in the one case, we seem bound to admit it, though
        perhaps in a less degree, in the other case also. In short, we
        conclude that the theory of dreams appears to be hardly enough by
        itself to account for the widespread belief in the immortality of men
        and animals; dreams have probably done much to confirm that belief,
        but would they suffice to originate it? We may reasonably doubt
        it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly we are

        arguing apparently from his own sensations he conceives of life as an
        indestructible <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg
        262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        kind of energy, which when it disappears in one form must necessarily
        reappear in another, though in the new form it need not be
        immediately perceptible by us; in other words, he infers that death
        does not destroy the vital principle nor even the conscious
        personality, but that it merely transforms both of them into other
        shapes, which are not the less real because they commonly elude the
        evidence of our senses. If I am right in thus interpreting the
        thought of primitive man, the savage view of the nature of life
        singularly resembles the modern scientific doctrine of the
        conservation of energy. According to that doctrine, no material
        energy ever perishes or is even diminished; when it seems to suffer
        diminution or extinction, all that happens is that a portion or the
        whole of it has been transmuted into other shapes which, though
        qualitatively different from, are quantitatively equivalent to, the
        energy in its original form. In short, if we listen to science,
        nothing in the physical world is ever lost, but all things are
        perpetually changing: the sum of energy in the universe is constant
        and invariable, though it undergoes ceaseless transformations.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">757</span></span></a> A
        similar theory of the indestructibility of energy is implicitly
        applied by the savage to explain the phenomena of life and death, and
        logically enough he does not limit the application to human beings
        but extends it to the lower animals. Therein he shews himself a
        better reasoner than his civilised brother, who commonly embraces
        with avidity the doctrine of human immortality but rejects with
        scorn, as derogatory to human dignity, the idea that animals have
        immortal souls. And when he attempts to confirm his own cherished
        belief in a life after death by appealing to similar beliefs among
        savages and inferring from them a natural instinct of immortality, it
        is well to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg
        263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        remind him that, if he stands by that appeal, he must, like the
        savage, consistently extend the privilege of immortality to the
        despised lower animals; for surely it is improper for him to pick and
        choose his evidence so as to suit his prepossessions, accepting those
        parts of the savage creed which tally with his own and rejecting
        those which do not. On logical and scientific grounds he seems bound
        to believe either more or less: he must hold that men and animals are
        alike immortal or that neither of them is so.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In more recent
        times the statement of Adair's informant has been confirmed by a
        French missionary, who has also published the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“obscure story”</span> to which the English traveller
        Hodgson refers. The Loucheux and Hare-skin Indians who roam the bleak
        steppes and forests that stretch from Hudson's Bay to the Rocky
        Mountains, and northward to the frozen sea, are forbidden by custom
        to eat the sinew of the legs of animals. To explain this custom they
        tell the following <span class="tei tei-q">“sacred story.”</span>
        Once upon a time a man found a burrow of porcupines, and going down
        into it after the porcupines he lost his way in the darkness, till a
        kind giant called <span class="tei tei-q">“He who sees before and
        behind”</span> released him by cleaving open the earth. So the man,
        whose name was <span class="tei tei-q">“Fireless and
        Homeless,”</span> lived with the kind giant, and the giant hunted
        elans and beavers for him, and carried him about in the sheath of his
        flint knife. <span class="tei tei-q">“But know, my son,”</span> said
        the giant, <span class="tei tei-q">“that he who uses the sky as his
        head is angry with me, and has sworn my destruction. If he slays me
        the clouds will be tinged with my blood; they will be red with it,
        probably.”</span> Then he gave the man an axe made of the tooth of a
        gigantic beaver, and went forth to meet his foe. But from under the
        ice the man heard a dull muffled sound. It was a whale which was
        making this noise because it was naked and cold. Warned by the man,
        the giant went toward the whale, which took human shape, and rushed
        upon the giant. It was the wicked giant, the kind giant's enemy. The
        two struggled together for a long time, till the kind giant cried,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, my son! cut, cut the sinew of the
        leg.”</span> The man cut the sinew, and the wicked giant fell down
        and was slain. That is why the Indians do not eat the sinew of the
        leg. Afterwards, one day the sky suddenly flushed a fiery red, so
        Fireless and Homeless knew that the kind giant was no more, and he
        wept.<a id="noteref_766" name="noteref_766" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This myth, it is
        almost needless to observe, does not really explain the custom.
        People do not usually observe a custom because on a particular
        occasion a mythical being is said to have acted in a certain way.
        But, on the contrary, they very often invent myths to explain why
        they practise certain customs. Dismissing, therefore, the story of
        Fireless and Homeless as a myth invented to explain why the Indians
        abstain from eating a particular sinew, it may be suggested<a id=
        "noteref_767" name="noteref_767" href="#note_767"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">767</span></span></a> that
        the original reason for observing the custom was a belief that the
        sinew in question was necessary to reproduction, and that deprived of
        it the slain animals could not come to life again and stock the
        steppes and prairies either of the present world or of the spirit
        land. We have seen that the resurrection of animals is a common
        article of savage faith, and that when the Lapps bury the skeleton of
        the male bear in the hope of its resurrection they are careful to
        bury the genital parts along with it. However, subsequent enquiries
        make it probable that the Indian practice of cutting out the
        hamstring of deer has no other object than that of preventing eaters
        of venison from going lame. Among the Cherokee, we are told,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“on killing a deer the hunter always makes an
        incision in the hind quarter and removes the hamstring, because this
        tendon, when severed, draws up into the flesh; ergo, any one who
        should unfortunately partake of the hamstring would find his limbs
        drawn up in the same manner.”</span><a id="noteref_768" name=

        seems to rest on the common principle of homoeopathic or imitative

        of whose flesh he partakes. Many instances of the application of that
        principle have met us already.<a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769"

        hamstring the game for a different purpose; they hope thereby to
        prevent the dead beast or its ghost from getting up and running away.
        This is the motive alleged for the practice by Koui hunters in Laos;
        they think that the spells which they utter in the chase may lose
        their magical virtue, and that the slaughtered animal may
        consequently come to life again and escape. To prevent that
        catastrophe they therefore hamstring the beast as soon as they have

        hamstringing the carcase is not the only measure which the prudent
        savage adopts for the sake of disabling the ghost of his victim. In
        old days, when the Aino went out hunting and killed a fox first, they
        took care to tie its mouth up tightly in order to prevent the ghost
        of the animal from sallying forth and warning its fellows against the

        dangerous ghost of the injured creature, and so to incapacitate it
        for retaliating on the slayer. Thus, when a Samoyed has killed a wild
        reindeer, one of the first things he does is to cut out the eyes and
        throw them away <span class="tei tei-q">“in order to ensure a good

        rational, not a superstitious, precaution. Thus the Kamtchatkans, who
        stab with knives the eyes of slain bears before they cut the carcases

        the severed parts were afterwards carefully fried, along with some
        medicinal herbs, in a horn by a medicine-man. The reasons for thus
        mutilating the animal were explained by a native to two French
        missionaries. <span class="tei tei-q">“If we cut out and purify the
        victim's tongue,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“the motive
        is to induce the guardian deities to prevent the enemy from speaking
        ill of us. We ask also that the sinews of their feet and hands may
        fail them in the battle; and that their eyes may not cast a covetous

        obviously prevent your enemy from cursing you, for how can he curse
        you if he has no tongue? Similarly, by hamstringing the beast you
        ensure that the legs and arms of your adversary will fail him in the
        battle, and by gouging out the ox's eye you make perfectly certain
        that the foe will never be able to cast a longing eye on your fat
        beeves. Thus for all practical purposes the mutilation of the ox is
        quite as effective as the mutilation of the enemy's dead, which is
        sometimes practised by savages from similar superstitious motives.
        Thus on the return from a field of battle the Baganda used to cut up
        one or two of the enemy's dead, scoop out the eyes, cut off the ears,
        and lay the limbs on the road taken by the returning army

        nature of the evil which the Baganda warriors feared to incur if they
        did not mutilate the dead in this fashion, is not mentioned, but we
        may conjecture that by gouging out the eyes and ears of their slain
        foes they hoped to make their angry ghosts blind and deaf; or
        perhaps, upon the principles of homoeopathic magic, they counted on
        maiming their living foes in like manner. Some of the aborigines of
        Australia cut off the thumbs of their dead enemies in order that
        their ghosts may not be able to throw spears.<a id="noteref_794"

        the Tupi Indians of Brazil killed and ate a prisoner, <span class=

        these Indians, like the Australians, thought by this mutilation to
        disarm the dangerous ghost of their victim. When any bad man died,
        the Esquimaux of Bering Strait used to cut the sinews of his arms and
        legs, <span class="tei tei-q">“in order to prevent the shade from
        returning to the body and causing it to walk at night as a

        Travancore the ghosts of men who have been hanged for murder are
        particularly dreaded; so in order to incapacitate them from roaming

        criminal's heels with a sword or hamstring him at the moment when he
        swung free from the ladder.<a id="noteref_798" name="noteref_798"

        Northern Rhodesia murderers often inflicted shocking mutilations on
        the bodies of their victims. <span class="tei tei-q">“This was done,
        it is said, to prevent the spirit of the murdered person from
        exacting vengeance, and even if only the joint of the first or the

        examples suggest that many other mutilations which savages practise
        on their dead enemies may spring, not from the blind fury of hatred,
        but from a cool calculation of the best mode of protecting themselves
        against the very natural resentment of the ghosts; by mutilating the
        corpse they apparently hope to maim the ghost and so to render him
        incapable of harming them. At all events it appears that in certain
        circumstances some savages treat the dead bodies of men and beasts
        much alike, by hamstringing them in order to prevent their ghosts
        from getting up and walking. So consistent and impartial is the
        primitive philosopher in his attitude to the spirit world.</p>

          animals which primitive man dreads for their strength and ferocity,
          and those which he reveres on account of the benefits which he
          expects from them, there is another class of creatures which he
          sometimes deems it necessary to conciliate by worship and
          sacrifice. These are the vermin that infest his crops and his
          cattle. To rid himself of these deadly foes the farmer has recourse
          to many superstitious devices, of which, though some are meant to
          destroy or intimidate the vermin, others aim at propitiating them
          and persuading them by fair means to spare the fruits of the earth
          and the herds. Thus Esthonian peasants, in the island of Oesel,
          stand in great awe of the weevil, an insect which is exceedingly
          destructive to the grain. They give it a fine name, and if a child
          is about to kill a weevil they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't
          do it; the more we hurt him, the more he hurts us.”</span> If they
          find a weevil they bury it in the earth instead of killing it. Some
          even put the weevil under a stone in the field and offer corn to
          it. They think that thus it is appeased and does less harm.<a id=

          Amongst the Saxons of Transylvania, in order to keep sparrows from
          the corn, the sower begins by throwing the first handful of seed
          backwards over his head, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“That is
          for you, sparrows.”</span> To guard the corn against the attacks of
          leaf-flies (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          shuts his eyes and scatters three handfuls of oats in different

          sure that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg

          they will spare the corn. A Transylvanian way of securing the crops
          against all birds, beasts, and insects, is this: after he has
          finished sowing, the sower goes once more from end to end of the
          field imitating the gesture of sowing, but with an empty hand. As
          he does so he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I sow this for the
          animals; I sow it for everything that flies and creeps, that walks

          they take care never to kill a weasel, lest the surviving kinsfolk
          of the deceased should avenge his death on the herds of his
          murderer. They even celebrate a festival of weasels either on St.
          Matthew's day (9th August, old style, 21st August, new style), or
          on St. Catherine's day (24th November, old style, 6th December, new

          Aino of Japan believe that God first created rats and mice at Erum
          kotan, which means <span class="tei tei-q">“rat place.”</span>
          Indeed, there are a great many rats and mice there even now, and
          the people of the village worship mice and offer them libations and
          sacred sticks whittled at the top into shavings. Grateful for these
          attentions, the mice spare the gardens and will not nibble at the
          roots and the fruits. But if the people omit to worship the mice,
          or if they are rash enough to speak evil of them, the creatures are
          angry and eat up the garden produce. The havoc which rats and mice
          now work in the gardens of the Aino every year is attributed to the
          modern neglect of the people to worship the vermin.<a id=

          Indian island of Bali, the mice which ravage the rice-fields are

          are burned. But two of the captured mice are allowed to live, and

          in the following manner. On a Friday, when the usual service in the
          mosque is over, four pairs of mice are solemnly united in marriage
          by the priest. Each pair is then shut up in a miniature canoe about
          a foot long. These canoes are filled with rice and other fruits of
          the earth, and the four pairs of mice are then escorted to the
          sea-shore just as if it were a real wedding. Wherever the
          procession passes the people beat with all their might on their
          rice-blocks. On reaching the shore, the canoes, with their little
          inmates, are launched and left to the mercy of the winds and

          birds and insects, they catch a specimen of each kind of vermin
          (one sparrow, one grasshopper and so on), put them in a tiny boat
          of bark well-stocked with provisions, and then allow the little
          vessel with its obnoxious passengers to float down the river. If
          that does not drive the pests away, the Dyaks resort to what they
          deem a more effectual mode of accomplishing the same purpose. They
          make a clay crocodile as large as life and set it up in the fields,
          where they offer it food, rice-spirit, and cloth, and sacrifice a
          fowl and a pig before it. Mollified by these attentions, the
          ferocious animal very soon gobbles up all the creatures that devour
          the crops.<a id="noteref_818" name="noteref_818" href=

          procession to a spring or stream, in which they drown the
          creatures. Then one of the women sings, <span class="tei tei-q">“O

          Arguing from the analogy of the preceding cases, we may suppose
          that at first the wolves themselves were propitiated by fair words
          and sacrifices to induce them to spare man and beast; and that at a
          later time, when the Greeks, or rather the enlightened portion of
          them, had outgrown this rude form of worship, they transferred the
          duty of keeping off the wolves to a beneficent deity who discharged
          the same useful office for other pests, such as mice, locusts, and
          mildew. A reminiscence of the direct propitiation of the fierce and
          dangerous beasts themselves is preserved in the legends told to
          explain the origin of the Lyceum or Place of Wolves at Athens and
          of the sanctuary of Wolfish Apollo at Sicyon. It is said that once,
          when Athens was infested by wolves, Apollo commanded sacrifices to
          be offered on the Place of Wolves and the smell <span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a>
          Similarly at Sicyon, when the flocks suffered heavily from the
          ravages of wolves, the same god directed the shepherds to set forth
          meat mixed with a certain bark, and the wolves devoured the tainted
          meat and perished.<a id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850" href=
          "#note_850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a> These
          legends probably reflect in a distorted form an old custom of
          sacrificing to the wolves, in other words of feeding them to
          mollify their ferocity and win their favour. We know that such a
          custom prevailed among the Letts down to comparatively recent
          times. In the month of December, about Christmas time, they
          sacrificed a goat to the wolves, with strange idolatrous rites, at
          a cross-road, for the purpose of inducing the wolves to spare the
          flocks and herds. After offering the sacrifice they used to brag
          that no beast of theirs would fall a victim to the ravening maw of
          a wolf for all the rest of that year, no, not though the pack were
          to run right through the herd. Sacrifices of this sort are reported
          to have been secretly offered by the Letts as late as the
          seventeenth century;<a id="noteref_851" name="noteref_851" href=

          if we knew more of peasant life in ancient Greece we might find
          that on winter days, while Aristotle was expounding his philosophy
          in the Lyceum or Place of Wolves at Athens, the Attic peasant was
          still carrying forth, in the crisp frosty air, his offering to the
          wolves, which all night long had been howling round his sheepfold
          in a snowy glen of Parnes or Pentelicus.</p>

        the Indians who were maintained at the Spanish missions and received
        their rations in the form of beef, had to overcome their
        conscientious scruples in regard to cattle. Once a half-caste,
        wishing to amuse himself at the expense of the devout, cooked a dish
        of bear's flesh for them and told them it was beef. They ate heartily
        of it, but when they learned the trick that had been played on them,
        they were seized with retchings, which only ended with the
        reappearance of the obnoxious meat. A reproach hurled by the wild

        which at evening quit the island by hundreds of thousands to fly
        towards the River Tanoe, which flows into the lagoon. The natives say

        to the holy isle and are bound to present themselves every night at
        the abode of Tano, the great and good fetish who dwells by the river
        of his name. Paddling past the island the negroes will not look at
        it, but turn away their heads. A European in crossing the lagoon

        lions. Their corpses are carried to a forest called Ensanzi, where
        they lie in state for several days. At the end of that time the body
        is supposed to burst and give forth a lion cub, which contains the
        spirit of the deceased king. The animal is nurtured by priests till
        it is grown up, when it is released and allowed to roam the forest
        with the other lions. It is the duty of the priests to feed and care
        for the lions and to hold communications with the dead kings when
        occasion arises. For that purpose the priests always live in a temple
        in the forest, where they receive frequent offerings of cattle for
        the lions. In this forest the lions are sacred and may not be killed,
        but in other parts of the country they may be slaughtered with
        impunity. Similarly, the Bahima think that at death the king's wives
        are changed into leopards; the transformation takes place in like
        manner through the bursting of the dead bodies in a belt of the same
        sacred forest. There the leopards are daily fed with offerings of
        meat by priests, whose office is hereditary. Further, the Bahima are
        of opinion that the spirits of dead princes and princesses come to
        life again in the form of snakes, which burst from their dead bodies
        in another belt of the same forest: there is a temple in the forest

        the Caffres of the Zambesi region, in Portuguese territory, who
        believe in the transmigration of human souls into the bodies of
        animals, judge of the species of animals into which a dead person has
        transmigrated by the resemblance which he bore to it in his life.

        an elephant; a strong man with a long beard will become a lion; an
        ugly man with a large mouth and thick lips will be a hyaena; and so
        on. Animals supposed to be tenanted by the spirits of the dead are
        treated as sacred and invulnerable. When a Portuguese lady, named
        Dona Maria, to whom the blacks were much attached, had departed this
        life, it chanced that a hyaena came repeatedly by night to the

        bowl. The largest of the worms which are bred in the putrid liquid is
        believed to contain the soul <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class=

        into a boa-constrictor. Accordingly these huge serpents are regarded
        as sacred by the Betsileo; nobody would dare to kill one of them. The
        people go down on their knees to them and salute them, just as they
        would do to a real live nobleman. It is a happy day when a
        boa-constrictor deigns to visit the village which he formerly
        inhabited in human form. He receives an ovation from his family. They
        go forth to meet him, spread silk for him to crawl upon, and carry
        him off to the public square, where he is allowed to gorge himself
        with the blood of a sacrificed ox. The souls of commoners of good
        standing transmigrate into the bodies of crocodiles, and in their new
        form still serve their old masters, particularly by announcing to
        them the approach of the hour when they must shuffle out of the human
        frame into the frame of boa-constrictors. Lastly, the scum of the
        population turn at death into eels, and to render the change as easy
        for them as possible it is customary to remove the bowels from the
        corpse and throw them into a sacred lake. The eel that swallows the
        first mouthful becomes the domicile of the soul of the deceased. No
        Betsileo would eat such eels.<a id="noteref_871" name="noteref_871"

        sharks happened to have a child still-born, he would endeavour to
        lodge the soul of the dead infant in the body of a shark. For this
        purpose he laid the tiny body, together with a couple of roots of
        taro, some kava, and a piece of sugar-cane, on a mat, recited prayers
        over it, and then flung the whole into the sea, believing that by
        virtue of this offering the transmigration of the child's soul into
        the shark's body would be effected, and that henceforth the voracious
        monsters would spare all members of the family who might otherwise be
        exposed to their attacks. In the temples dedicated to sharks there
        were priests who, morning and evening, addressed prayers to the
        shark-idol, and rubbed their bodies with water and salt, which,
        drying on their skin, imparted to it an appearance of being covered

        tiger is brought into it, they are bound to pay special marks of

        this kind, and that, since they cannot distinguish this incarnation
        of his ancestor from other deer, they must abstain from killing all
        deer of this species. We know of one instance in which one of these
        people refused to use again his cooking-pot which a Malay had
        borrowed and used for cooking the flesh of this deer. This
        superstition is still rigidly adhered to, although these people have

        (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=

        to the muntjac deer also. Now these people live in a country in which
        deer of all kinds abound, and they always make a clearing in the
        jungle around a tomb. On such a clearing grass grows up rapidly, and
        so the spot becomes attractive to deer as a grazing ground; and it
        seems not improbable that it is through frequently seeing deer about
        the tombs that the people have come to entertain the belief that
        their dead relatives become deer or that they are in some other way

        "font-style: italic">Paradoxurus</span></span>, and in this case the
        origin of the belief is admitted by them to be the fact that on going
        to their graveyards they often see one of these beasts coming out of
        a tomb. These tombs are roughly constructed wooden coffins raised a
        few feet only from the ground, and it is probable that these
        carnivores make their way into them in the first place to devour the

        make a humming sound at the initiatory rites of young men. But when

        people, who inhabit the rugged and densely wooded mountains inland
        from Finsch Harbour in German New Guinea, imagine that the gloomy
        depths of some wild ravines are haunted by the souls of the dead in
        the form of cuscuses and other animals. None but the owner has the
        right to kill game in these dark and awful gullies, and even he must
        propitiate the soul of every animal that he slays in such a spot. For
        this purpose he spreads out offerings on the carcase and presents
        them to the injured spirit, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Take the

        leaving the articles long enough to allow the soul of the beast to
        abstract and convey away the souls of the things, the hunter is free
        to cut up and consume the carcase. Some years ago, when heavy rains
        caused a land-slip in these wild mountains, and a house with its
        inmates was buried in the ruins, public opinion in the neighbourhood
        attributed the disaster to the misconduct of the deceased, who had

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Solomon
        Islands a man at the point of death would gather the members of his
        family about him and inform them of the particular sort of creature,
        say a bird or a butterfly, into which he proposed to transmigrate.
        Henceforth the family would regard that species of animal as sacred
        and would neither kill nor injure it. If they fell in with a creature
        of the kind, it might be a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg

        these islands sharks are very often supposed to be ghosts, for dying
        people frequently announce their intention of being sharks when they
        have put off their human shape. After that, if any shark remarkable
        for its size or colour is seen to haunt a certain shore or rock, it
        is taken to be somebody's ghost, and the name of the deceased is
        given to it. For example, at Ulawa a dreaded man-eating shark
        received the name of a dead man and was propitiated with offerings of
        porpoise teeth. At Saa, certain food, for example coco-nuts from
        particular trees, is reserved to feed such a ghost-shark, but men of
        whom it is positively known that after death they will be in sharks
        are allowed by anticipation to partake of the shark-food in the
        sacred place. Other men will sometimes join themselves to their
        company, and speaking with the voice of a shark-ghost will say,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me to eat of that food.”</span> If such
        a man happens to be really possessed of supernatural power, he will
        in due time become a shark-ghost himself; but it is perfectly
        possible that he may fail. In Savo not very long ago a certain man
        had a shark that he used to feed and to which he offered sacrifice.
        He swam out to it with food, called it by name, and it came to him.
        Of course it was not a common shark, but a ghost, the knowledge of
        which had been handed down to him from his ancestors. Alligators also
        may lodge the souls of dead Solomon Islanders. In the island of
        Florida a story was told of an alligator that used to come up out of
        the sea and make itself quite at home in the village in which the man
        whose ghost it was had lived. It went by the name of the deceased,
        and though there was one man in particular who had special connexion
        with it and was said to own it, the animal was on friendly terms with
        everybody in the place and would even let children ride on its back.
        But the village where this happened has not yet been
        identified.<a id="noteref_893" name="noteref_893" href=
        "#note_893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        same island the appearance of anything wonderful is taken as proof of
        a ghostly presence and stamps the place as sacred. For example, a man
        planted some coco-nut palms <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg
        298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        almond trees in the bush and died not long afterwards. After his
        death there appeared among the trees a great rarity in the shape of a
        white cuscus. The animal was accordingly assumed to be the ghost of
        the departed planter and went by his name. The place became sacred,
        and no one would gather the fruits of the trees there, until two
        young men, who had been trained in the principles of Christianity,
        boldly invaded the sanctuary and appropriated the almonds and
        coco-nuts.<a id="noteref_894" name="noteref_894" href=
        "#note_894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        not be supposed, however, that the choice of transmigration open to a
        Solomon Islander is restricted to the animal kingdom; he is free
        after death to become a vegetable, if he feels so disposed. When a
        mission-school was established in the island of Ulawa it was observed
        with surprise that the natives would not eat bananas and had ceased
        to plant the tree. Enquiry elicited the origin of the restriction,
        which was recent and well remembered. A man of great influence, dying
        not long before, had forbidden the eating of bananas after his death,
        saying that he would be in the banana. The older natives would still
        mention his name and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We cannot eat

        as a philosophical theory, but as a means of enforcing moral lessons,
        by thinkers, teachers, and lawgivers among various civilised peoples,
        notably in ancient India and Greece. Thus in the most famous of old
        Indian law-books, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        nothing to be desired: the degradation of the birth is exactly
        proportioned to the degree of moral guilt of the transgressor. For
        example, if a man has the temerity to censure his teacher, even
        though the censure is richly deserved, that rash man in his next

        twice a pig, twice a frog, four times a serpent, six times a snipe,
        ten times a lion, eleven times a deer, and eighteen times a monkey;

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In ancient Greece
        also the theory of the transmigration of souls found favour with the
        early philosophers Pythagoras and Empedocles, both of whom, if we may
        trust tradition, appealed to their own personal experience in support
        of the doctrine. According to ancient writers, Pythagoras affirmed
        that he had been Euphorbus the Trojan in one of his former lives, and
        in proof of the assertion he identified the shield of Euphorbus among
        the Trojan spoils at Mycenae.<a id="noteref_901" name="noteref_901"

        would seem to have held that human souls can transmigrate into
        animals or even into plants;<a id="noteref_902" name="noteref_902"
        href="#note_902"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">902</span></span></a> and we
        may suppose that the possibility of such transmigrations was at least
        one of the reasons he alleged for enjoining the strictest of his
        disciples neither to kill nor to eat animals and to abstain from
        certain vegetables, such as beans and mallows.<a id="noteref_903"
        name="noteref_903" href="#note_903"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">903</span></span></a>
        Certainly at a later time these principles were maintained and these
        precepts inculcated by Empedocles, who outdid the reminiscences of
        his predecessor by asserting that he himself in former lives had been
        a boy, a girl, a bush, a bird, and a fish.<a id="noteref_904" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">904</span></span></a> Hence
        he denounced as a crime the practice of killing and eating animals,
        since according to him a man could never know but that in
        slaughtering and eating an animal he might be murdering and devouring
        one of his dead kinsfolk, it might be his father or mother, his son
        or daughter.<a id="noteref_905" name="noteref_905" href=
        "#note_905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">905</span></span></a> Thus
        from the doctrine of transmigration Empedocles logically drew the
        same practical conclusion as the savage, who abstains, for example,
        from killing and eating crocodiles or pigs because he believes the
        souls of his departed relations to be embodied in crocodiles or pigs:
        the only important difference between the savage and the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> philosopher in this respect is that,
        whereas the savage venerates and spares only animals of one
        particular species on the ground of their possible affinity to
        himself, the philosopher on his own shewing was bound to abstain from
        all animals whatever, since according to him the spirits of his
        deceased relatives might be lurking in creatures of any species.
        Hence while a faith in transmigration imposes but few restrictions on
        the diet of a savage, since it leaves him free to partake of the
        flesh of every sort of animals but one, the creed of Empedocles
        logically cut him off from a flesh diet altogether and compelled him
        to live on vegetables alone; indeed, if he had been rigidly logical,
        he must have denied himself the use of vegetables also and perished
        of hunger, since on his theory vegetables as well as animals may
        house the souls of the dead.<a id="noteref_906" name="noteref_906"

        However, like a wise man he sacrificed logic to life, and contented
        himself with forbidding his disciples the use of a few vegetables,
        such as beans and laurels,<a id="noteref_907" name="noteref_907"

        followers the necessity of leading an innocent, pure, and even

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if on its
        ethical side the teaching of Empedocles may almost be described as
        Buddhism relieved of its deepest shadows, on its scientific side it
        curiously anticipated some speculations which have deeply stirred the
        European mind in our own and our fathers' days. For to his savage
        psychology and religious mysticism Empedocles superadded a
        comprehensive and grandiose theory of the material universe, which
        presents a close analogy to that of Herbert Spencer. The scientific
        doctrine of the conservation of energy or, as he preferred to call
        it, the persistence of force, which Spencer made the corner-stone of
        his system, has its counterpart in the Empedoclean doctrine of the
        conservation or indestructibility of matter, the sum of which,
        according to him, remains always constant, never undergoing either
        increase or diminution.<a id="noteref_916" name="noteref_916" href=
        "#note_916"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        all the changes that take place in the physical world, according to
        Empedocles, resolve themselves into the integration and
        disintegration of matter, the composition and decomposition of
        bodies, brought about by the two antagonistic forces of attraction
        and repulsion, which in mythical language he called love and hate.
        And just as all particular things are evolved by the force of
        attraction and dissolved by the force of repulsion, a state of
        concentration or aggregation in the individual perpetually
        alternating with a state of diffusion or segregation, so it is also
        with the material universe as a whole. It, too, alternately contracts
        and expands according as the forces of attraction and repulsion
        alternately prevail. For it was the opinion of Empedocles that a
        long, perhaps immeasurable, period of time, during which the force of
        attraction prevails over the force of repulsion, is succeeded by an
        equally long period in which the force of repulsion prevails over the
        force of attraction, each period lasting till, the predominant force
        being spent, its action is first arrested and then reversed by the
        opposite force; so that the material universe performs a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> periodic and rhythmic movement of
        alternate contraction and expansion, which never ceases except at the
        moments when, the two opposite forces exactly balancing each other,
        all things come to rest and equilibrium for a time, only however to
        return, with the backward sweep of the cosmic pendulum, to their
        former state either of consolidation or of dispersion. Thus under the
        influence of attraction and repulsion matter is constantly
        oscillating to and fro: at the end of a period of contraction it is
        gathered up in a solid globe: at the end of a period of expansion it
        is diffused throughout space in a state of tenuity which nowadays we
        might describe as gaseous. And this gigantic see-saw motion of the
        universe as a whole has gone on and will go on for ever and
        ever.<a id="noteref_917" name="noteref_917" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The imposing
        generalisation thus formulated by Empedocles in the fifth century
        before our era was enunciated independently in the nineteenth century
        of our era by Herbert Spencer. Like his Greek predecessor, the modern
        English philosopher held that the material universe passes through
        alternate periods of concentration and dissipation, of evolution and
        dissolution, according as the forces of attraction and repulsion
        alternately prevail. The terms in which he sums up his general
        conclusions might be used with hardly any change to describe the
        conclusions of Empedocles. For the sake of comparison it may be well
        to subjoin the passage. It runs as follows:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thus we are led to the conclusion that the entire
        process of things, as displayed in the aggregate of the visible
        Universe, is analogous to the entire process of things as displayed
        in the smallest aggregates.</span></p>

        indestructible Motion thereupon necessitates a reverse distribution.
        Apparently, the universally <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg

        coexistent forces of attraction and repulsion, which, as we have

        Universe, also necessitate rhythm in the totality of its
        changes—produce now an immeasurable period during which the
        attractive forces predominating, cause universal concentration, and
        then an immeasurable period during which the repulsive forces
        predominating, cause universal diffusion—alternate eras of Evolution
        and Dissolution. And thus there is suggested the conception of a past
        during which there have been successive Evolutions analogous to that
        which is now going on; and a future during which successive other
        such Evolutions may go on—ever the same in principle but never the

        researches in physical science tend apparently rather to confirm than
        to invalidate these general views of the nature of the universe; for
        if modern physicists are right in regarding the constitution of
        matter as essentially electrical, the antagonistic forces of
        attraction and repulsion postulated by Empedocles and Spencer would
        resolve themselves into positive and negative electricity. On the
        other hand the atomic disintegration which is now known to be
        proceeding in certain of the chemical elements, particularly in
        uranium and radium, and which is probably proceeding in all, suggests
        a doubt whether the universe is really, as Spencer supposed, in
        process of integration and evolution and not rather in process of
        disintegration and dissolution; or whether perhaps the apparent
        evolution of the organic world is not attended by a simultaneous
        dissolution of the inorganic, so that the fabric of the universe
        would be a sort of Penelope's web, which the great artificer weaves

        trouble the outlook on the future, we may perhaps say that Empedocles

        question undecided, whether during the epoch open to human
        observation the force of attraction or that of repulsion has been and
        is predominant, and consequently whether matter as a whole is
        integrating or disintegrating, whether all things are gradually
        evolving into more complex and concentrated forms, or are gradually
        dissolving and wasting away, through simpler and simpler forms, into
        the diffused tenuity of their primordial constituents.</p>

        Empedocles anticipated to some extent the theories of Spencer, so in

        extent the theories of Darwin; for he held that the existing species
        of animals have been evolved out of inorganic matter through

        Empedocles himself clearly enunciated the principle of the survival
        of the fittest as well as the doctrine of evolution, we cannot say
        with certainty; but at all events it is significant that Aristotle,
        after stating for the first time the principle of the survival of the
        fittest, illustrates it by a reference to Empedocles's theory of the

        instance of the strange complexities and seeming inconsistencies of
        human nature, that a man whose capacious mind revolved ideas so
        far-reaching and fruitful, should have posed among his contemporaries
        as a prophet or even as a god, parading the streets of his native
        city bedecked with garlands and ribbons and followed by obsequious
        crowds of men and women, who worshipped him and prayed to him that he

        character of Empedocles, as in that of another forerunner of science,
        Paracelsus, the sterling qualities of the genuine student would seem
        to have been alloyed with a vein of ostentation and braggadocio; but
        the dash of the mountebank which we may detect in his composition
        probably helped rather than hindered him to win for a time the favour
        and catch the ear of the multitude, ever ready as they are to troop
        at the heels of any quack who advertises his wares by a loud blast on
        a brazen trumpet. With so many claims on the admiration of the wise
        and the adulation of the foolish, we may almost wonder that
        Empedocles did not become the founder, if not the god, of a new
        religion. Certainly other human deities have set up in business and
        prospered with an intellectual stock-in-trade much inferior to that
        of the Sicilian philosopher. Perhaps Empedocles lacked that perfect
        sincerity of belief in his own pretensions without which it seems
        difficult or impossible permanently to impose on the credulity of
        mankind. To delude others successfully it is desirable, if not
        absolutely necessary, to begin by being one's self deluded, and the
        Sicilian sage was probably too shrewd a man to feel perfectly at ease
        in the character of a god.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old savage
        doctrine of the transmigration of souls, which Empedocles furbished

        "page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> as a philosophical tenet, was afterwards
        countenanced, if not expressly affirmed, by another Greek philosopher
        of a very different stamp, who united, as no one else has ever done
        in the same degree, the highest capacity for abstract thought with
        the most exquisite literary genius. But if he borrowed the doctrine
        from savagery, Plato, like his two predecessors, detached it from its
        rude original setting and fitted it into an edifying moral scheme of
        retributive justice. For he held that the transmigration of human
        souls after death into the bodies of animals is a punishment or
        degradation entailed on the souls by the weaknesses to which they had
        been subject or the vices to which they had been addicted in life,
        and that the kind of animal into which a peccant soul transmigrates
        is appropriate to the degree and nature of its weakness or guilt.
        Thus, for example, the souls of gluttons, sots, and rakes pass into
        the bodies of asses; the souls of robbers and tyrants are born again
        in wolves and hawks; the souls of sober quiet people, untinctured by
        philosophy, come to life as bees and ants; a bad poet may turn at
        death into a swan or a nightingale; and a bad jester into an ape.
        Nothing but a rigid practice of the highest virtue and a
        single-minded devotion to abstract truth will avail to restore such
        degraded souls to their human dignity and finally raise them to
        communion with the gods.<a id="noteref_923" name="noteref_923" href=
        "#note_923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        the passages in which these views are set forth have a mythical
        colouring and are, like all Plato's writings, couched in dramatic
        form and put into the mouths of others, we need not seriously doubt
        that they represent the real opinion of the philosopher

        philosophic system of a great Greek thinker. So curiously alike may

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are now
          perhaps in a position to understand the ambiguous behaviour of the
          Aino and Gilyaks towards the bear. It has been shewn that the sharp
          line of demarcation which we draw between mankind and the lower
          animals does not exist for the savage. To him many of the other
          animals appear as his equals or even his superiors, not merely in
          brute force but in intelligence; and if choice or necessity leads
          him to take their lives, he feels bound, out of regard to his own
          safety, to do it in a way which will be as inoffensive as possible
          not merely to the living animal, but to its departed spirit and to
          all the other animals of the same species, which would resent an
          affront put upon one of their kind much as a tribe of savages would
          revenge an injury or insult offered to a tribesman. We have seen
          that among the many devices by which the savage seeks to atone for
          the wrong done by him to his animal victims one is to shew marked
          deference to a few chosen individuals of the species, for such
          behaviour is apparently regarded as entitling him to exterminate
          with impunity all the rest of the species upon which he can lay
          hands. This principle perhaps explains the attitude, at first sight
          puzzling and contradictory, of the Aino towards the bear. The flesh
          and skin of the bear regularly afford them food and clothing; but
          since the bear is an intelligent and powerful animal, it is
          necessary to offer some satisfaction or atonement to the bear
          species for the loss which it sustains in the death of so many of
          its members. This satisfaction or atonement is <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> made by rearing young bears, treating
          them, so long as they live, with respect, and killing them with
          extraordinary marks of sorrow and devotion. So the other bears are
          appeased, and do not resent the slaughter of their kind by
          attacking the slayers or deserting the country, which would deprive
          the Aino of one of their means of subsistence.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
          primitive worship of animals assumes two forms, which are in some
          respects the converse of each other. On the one hand, animals are
          worshipped, and are therefore neither killed nor eaten. On the
          other hand, animals are worshipped because they are habitually
          killed and eaten. In both forms of worship the animal is revered on
          account of some benefit, positive or negative, which the savage
          hopes to receive from it. In the former worship the benefit comes
          either in the positive form of protection, advice, and help which
          the animal affords the man, or in the negative one of abstinence
          from injuries which it is in the power of the animal to inflict. In
          the latter worship the benefit takes the material form of the
          animal's flesh and skin. The two forms of worship are in some
          measure antithetical: in the one, the animal is not eaten because
          it is revered; in the other, it is revered because it is eaten. But
          both may be practised by the same people, as we see in the case of
          the North American Indians, who, while they apparently revere and
          spare their totem animals,<a id="noteref_926" name="noteref_926"
          href="#note_926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a> also
          revere the animals and fish upon which they subsist. The aborigines
          of Australia have totemism in the most primitive form known to us;
          but, so far as I am aware, there is no clear evidence that they
          attempt, like the North American Indians, to conciliate the animals
          which they kill and eat. The means which the Australians adopt to
          secure a plentiful supply of game appear to be primarily based, not
          on conciliation, but on sympathetic magic,<a id="noteref_927" name=
          "noteref_927" href="#note_927"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a> a
          principle to which the North American <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Indians also resort for the same
          purpose.<a id="noteref_928" name="noteref_928" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">928</span></span></a>
          Hence, as the Australians undoubtedly represent a ruder and earlier
          stage of human progress than the American Indians, it would seem
          that before hunters think of worshipping the game as a means of
          ensuring an abundant supply of it, they seek to attain the same end
          by sympathetic magic. This, again, would shew—what there is good
          reason for believing—that sympathetic magic is one of the earliest
          means by which man endeavours to adapt the agencies of nature to
          his needs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corresponding to
          the two distinct types of animal worship, there are two distinct
          types of the custom of killing the animal god. On the one hand,
          when the revered animal is habitually spared, it is nevertheless
          killed—and sometimes eaten—on rare and solemn occasions. Examples
          of this custom have been already given and an explanation of them
          offered. On the other hand, when the revered animal is habitually
          killed, the slaughter of any one of the species involves the
          killing of the god, and is atoned for on the spot by apologies and
          sacrifices, especially when the animal is a powerful and dangerous
          one; and, in addition to this ordinary and everyday atonement,
          there is a special annual atonement, at which a select individual
          of the species is slain with extraordinary marks of respect and
          devotion. Clearly the two types of sacramental killing—the Egyptian
          and the Aino types, as we may call them for distinction—are liable
          to be confounded by an observer; and, before we can say to which
          type any particular example belongs, it is necessary to ascertain
          whether the animal sacramentally slain belongs <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to a species which is habitually
          spared, or to one which is habitually killed by the tribe. In the
          former case the example belongs to the Egyptian type of sacrament,
          in the latter to the Aino type.</p>

          obliged to sell their herds to strangers who may handle the bones
          disrespectfully, seek to avert the danger which such a sacrilege
          would entail by consecrating one of the herd as an object of
          worship, eating it sacramentally in the family circle with closed
          doors, and afterwards treating the bones with all the ceremonious
          respect which, strictly speaking, should be accorded to every head
          of cattle, but which, being punctually paid to the representative
          animal, is deemed to be paid to all. Such family meals are found
          among various peoples, especially those of the Caucasus. When
          amongst the Abchases the shepherds in spring eat their common meal
          with their loins girt and their staves in their hands, this may be
          looked upon both as a sacrament and as an oath of mutual help and
          support. For the strongest of all oaths is that which is
          accompanied with the eating of a sacred substance, since the
          perjured person cannot possibly escape the avenging god whom he has
          taken into his body and assimilated.”</span><a id="noteref_929"

          kind of sacrament is of the Aino or expiatory type, since it is
          meant to atone to the species for the possible ill-usage of
          individuals. An expiation, similar in principle but different in
          details, is offered by the Kalmucks to the sheep, whose flesh is
          one of their staple foods. Rich Kalmucks are in the habit of
          consecrating a white ram under the title of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the ram of heaven”</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the ram of the spirit.”</span> The animal is never

          a new one, the old ram must be killed and eaten at a feast to which
          the neighbours are invited. On a lucky day, generally in autumn
          when the sheep are fat, a sorcerer kills the old ram, after
          sprinkling it with milk. Its flesh is eaten; the skeleton, with a
          portion of the fat, is burned on a turf altar; and the skin, with
          the head and feet, is hung up.<a id="noteref_930" name=

          never eat the flesh of the cow buffalo, and as a rule abstain from
          the flesh of the male. But to the latter rule there is a single
          exception. Once a year all the adult males of the village join in
          the ceremony of killing and eating a very young male
          calf,—seemingly under a month old. They take the animal into the
          dark recesses of the village wood, where it is killed with a club
          made from the sacred tree of the Todas (the <span class=

          having been made by the rubbing of sticks, the flesh of the calf is
          roasted on the embers of certain trees, and is eaten by the men
          alone, women being excluded from the assembly. This is the only
          occasion on which the Todas eat buffalo flesh.<a id="noteref_932"

          Madi or Moru tribe of Central Africa, whose chief wealth is their
          cattle, though they also practise agriculture, appear to kill a
          lamb sacramentally on certain solemn occasions. The custom is thus
          described by Dr. Felkin: <span class="tei tei-q">“A remarkable
          custom is observed at stated times—once a year, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> I am led to believe. I have not been
          able to ascertain what exact meaning is attached to it. It appears,
          however, to relieve the people's minds, for beforehand they evince
          much sadness, and seem very joyful when the ceremony is duly
          accomplished. The following is what takes place: A large concourse
          of people of all ages assemble, and sit down round a circle of
          stones, which is erected by the side of a road (really a narrow
          path). A very choice lamb is then fetched by a boy, who leads it
          four times round the assembled people. As it passes they pluck off
          little bits of its fleece and place them in their hair, or on to
          some other part of their body. The lamb is then led up to the
          stones, and there killed by a man belonging to a kind of priestly
          order, who takes some of the blood and sprinkles it four times over
          the people. He then applies it individually. On the children he
          makes a small ring of blood over the lower end of the breast bone,
          on women and girls he makes a mark above the breasts, and the men
          he touches on each shoulder. He then proceeds to explain the
          ceremony, and to exhort the people to show kindness.... When this
          discourse, which is at times of great length, is over, the people
          rise, each places a leaf on or by the circle of stones, and then
          they depart with signs of great joy. The lamb's skull is hung on a
          tree near the stones, and its flesh is eaten by the poor. This
          ceremony is observed on a small scale at other times. If a family
          is in any great trouble, through illness or bereavement, their
          friends and neighbours come together and a lamb is killed; this is
          thought to avert further evil. The same custom prevails at the
          grave of departed friends, and also on joyful occasions, such as
          the return of a son home after a very prolonged
          absence.”</span><a id="noteref_933" name="noteref_933" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When every house
          has been thus visited, the dough snake is buried and a small grave
          is erected over it. Thither during the nine days of September the
          women come to worship. They bring a basin of curds, a small portion
          of which they offer at the snake's grave, kneeling on the ground
          and touching the earth with their foreheads. Then they go home and
          divide the rest of the curds among the children. Here the dough
          snake is clearly a substitute for a real snake. Indeed, in
          districts where snakes abound the worship is offered, not at the
          grave of the dough snake, but in the jungles where snakes are known
          to be. Besides this yearly worship, performed by all the people,
          the members of the Snake tribe worship in the same way every
          morning after a new moon. The Snake tribe is not uncommon in the
          Punjaub. Members of it will not kill a snake, and they say that its
          bite does not hurt them. If they find a dead snake, they put
          clothes on it and give it a regular funeral.<a id="noteref_937"

          closely analogous to this Indian worship of the snake have survived
          in Europe into recent times, and doubtless date from a very
          primitive paganism. The best-known example is the <span class=

          peoples—the ancient Greeks and Romans, the modern Italians,
          Spaniards, French, Germans, Dutch, Danes, Swedes, English, and
          Welsh—the wren has been designated the king, the little king, the
          king of birds, the hedge king, and so forth,<a id="noteref_938"

          has been reckoned amongst those birds which it is extremely unlucky
          to kill. In England it is supposed that if any one kills a wren or
          harries its nest, he will infallibly break a bone or meet with some
          dreadful misfortune within the year;<a id="noteref_939" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
          such beliefs, the custom of annually killing the wren has prevailed
          widely both in this country and in France. In the Isle of Man down
          to the eighteenth century the custom was observed on Christmas Eve
          or rather Christmas morning. On the twenty-fourth of December,
          towards evening, all the servants got a holiday; they did not go to
          bed all night, but rambled about till the bells rang in all the
          churches at midnight. When prayers were over, they went to hunt the
          wren, and having found one of these birds they killed it and
          fastened it to the top of a long pole with its wings extended. Thus
          they carried it in procession to every house chanting the following

          gone from house to house and collected all the money they could,

          parish churchyard, where they made a grave and buried it
          <span class="tei tei-q">“with the utmost solemnity, singing dirges

          formed a circle and danced to music. About the middle of the
          nineteenth century the burial of the wren took place in the Isle of
          Man on St. Stephen's Day (the twenty-sixth of December). Boys went
          from door to door with a wren suspended by the legs in the centre
          of two hoops, which crossed each other at right angles and were
          decorated with evergreens and ribbons. The bearers sang certain
          lines in which reference was made to boiling and eating the bird.
          If at the close of the song they received a small coin, they gave
          in return a feather of the wren; so that before the end of the day
          the bird often hung almost featherless. The wren was then buried,
          no longer in the churchyard, but on the sea-shore or in some waste
          place. The feathers distributed were preserved with religious care,
          it being believed that every feather was an effectual preservative
          from shipwreck for a year, and a fisherman would have been thought
          very foolhardy who had not one of them.<a id="noteref_944" name=

          Saint Jean used to go out of the town armed with sticks, with which
          they beat the bushes, looking for wrens. The first to strike down
          one of these birds was proclaimed King. Then they returned to the

          hunted the wren marched through the streets of the town to the
          light of torches, with drums beating and fifes playing in front of
          them. At the door of every house they stopped, and one of them
          wrote with chalk on the door <span lang="fr" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vive le roi!</span></span> with the number of
          the year which was about to begin. On the morning of Twelfth Day
          the King again marched in procession with great pomp, wearing a
          crown and a blue mantle and carrying a sceptre. In front of him was
          borne the wren fastened to the top of a pole, which was adorned
          with a verdant wreath of olive, of oak, and sometimes of mistletoe
          grown on an oak. After hearing high mass in the parish church of
          St. Vincent, surrounded by his officers and guards, the King
          visited the bishop, the mayor, the magistrates, and the chief
          inhabitants, collecting money to defray the expenses of the royal
          banquet which took place in the evening and wound up with a
          dance.<a id="noteref_950" name="noteref_950" href=
          "#note_950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">950</span></span></a> At
          Entraigues men and boys used to hunt the wren on Christmas Eve.
          When they caught one alive they presented it to the priest, who,
          after the midnight mass, set the bird free in the church. At
          Mirabeau the priest blessed the bird. If the men failed to catch a
          wren and the women succeeded in doing so, the women had the right
          to mock and insult the men, and to blacken their faces with mud and
          soot, when they caught them.<a id="noteref_951" name="noteref_951"

          Ciotat, near Marseilles, a large body of men armed with swords and
          pistols used to hunt the wren every year about the end of December.
          When a wren was caught it was hung on the middle of a pole, which
          two men carried, as if it were a heavy burden. Thus they paraded
          round the town; the bird was weighed in a great pair of scales; and
          then the company sat down to table and made merry.<a id=

          some of those which we have considered, especially the Gilyak
          procession with the bear, and the Indian one with the snake, seems
          too close to allow us to doubt that they all belong to the same
          circle of ideas. The worshipful animal is killed with special
          solemnity once a year; and before or immediately after death he is
          promenaded from door to door, that each of his worshippers may
          receive a portion of the divine virtues that are supposed to
          emanate from the dead or dying god. Religious processions of this
          sort must have had a great place in the ritual of European peoples
          in prehistoric times, if we may judge from the numerous traces of
          them which have survived in folk-custom. A well-preserved specimen
          is the following, which lasted in the Highlands of Scotland and in
          St. Kilda down at least to the latter half of the eighteenth
          century. It was described to Dr. Samuel Johnson in the island of

          Another description of it runs as follows: <span class=

          the cowherd and the young people to meet together, and one of them
          is covered with a cow's hide. The rest of the company are provided
          with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name=

          according to the course of the sun; the rest pursue, beating the
          hide with their staves, and crying [here follows the Gaelic],
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let us raise the noise louder and louder;
          let us beat the hide.’</span> They then come to the door of each
          dwelling-house, and one of them repeats some verses composed for
          the purpose. When admission is granted, one of them pronounces
          within the threshold the <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">beannachadthurlair</span></span>, or verses by
          which he pretends to draw down a blessing upon the whole family

          Another writer who gives a similar account of the ceremony and of
          the verses sung by the performers, tells us that the intention of
          putting the burnt sheep-skin to the noses of the people was to
          protect them against witchcraft and every infection.<a id=

          explanation, which is doubtless correct, reminds us of the
          extraordinarily persistent hold which the belief in sorcery and
          witchcraft has retained on the minds of the European peasantry.
          Formerly, perhaps, pieces of the cow-hide in which the man was clad
          were singed and put to the noses of the people, just as in the Isle
          of Man a feather of the wren used to be given to each household.
          Similarly, as we have seen, the human victim whom the Khonds slew
          as a divinity was taken from house to house, and every one
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name=

          procession with the man clad in a cow-skin, there is nothing to
          shew that the customs in question have any relation to agriculture.
          So far as appears, they may date from a time before the invention
          of husbandry when animals were revered as divine in themselves, not
          merely as divine because they embodied the corn-spirit; and the
          analogy of the Gilyak procession of the bear and the Indian
          procession of the snake is in favour of assigning the corresponding
          European customs to this very early date. On the other hand, there
          are certain European processions of animals, or of men disguised as
          animals, which may perhaps be purely agricultural in their origin;
          in other words, the animals which figure in them may have been from
          the first nothing but representatives of the corn-spirit conceived
          in animal shape. Examples of such dramatic and at the same time
          religious rites have been collected by W. Mannhardt, who says of
          them in general: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not only on the harvest
          field and on the threshing-floor but also quite apart from them
          people loved to represent the corn-spirit dramatically, especially
          in solemn processions in spring and about the winter solstice,
          whereby they meant to depict the return of the beneficent powers of
          summer to the desolate realm of nature.”</span><a id="noteref_958"

          for example, in country districts of Bohemia it is, or used to be,
          customary during the last days of the Carnival for young men to go
          about in procession from house to house collecting gratuities.
          Usually a man or boy is swathed from head to foot in pease-straw
          and wrapt round in straw-ropes: thus attired he goes by the name of
          the Shrovetide or Carnival Bear (<span lang="de" class=

          the girls, the maids, and the housewife herself, and drinks to the
          health of the good man, the good wife, and the girls. For this
          performance the mummer is regaled with food by the good wife, while
          the good man puts money in his box. When the mummers have gone the
          round of the village, they betake themselves to the ale-house,
          whither also all the peasants repair with their wives; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“for at Shrovetide, but especially on Shrove Tuesday,
          every one must dance, if the flax, the vegetables, and the corn are
          to thrive; and the more and the higher they dance, the greater the
          blessing which the people expect to crown their exertions.”</span>
          In the Leitmeritz district the Shrovetide Bear, besides being wrapt
          in straw, sometimes wears a bear's mask to emphasise his
          resemblance to the animal. In the Czech villages the housewives
          pluck the pease-straw and other straw from the Shrovetide Bear and
          put it in the nests of their geese, believing that the geese will
          lay more eggs and hatch their broods better for the addition of
          this straw to their nests. For a similar purpose in the Saaz
          district the women put the straw of the Shrovetide Bear in the
          nests of their hens.<a id="noteref_959" name="noteref_959" href=

          the use of the straw to make the geese and hens lay more eggs,
          sufficiently prove that the Shrovetide Bear is conceived to
          represent the spirit of fertility both animal and vegetable; and we
          may reasonably conjecture that the dances of the mummer with the
          women and girls are especially intended to convey to them the
          fertilising powers of the spirit whom the mummer personates.<a id=

          conception of him as a bear seems to be less common. In the
          neighbourhood of Gniewkowo, in Prussian Lithuania, the two ideas
          are combined, for on Twelfth Day a man wrapt in pease-straw to
          represent a Bear and another wrapt in oats-straw to represent a
          Goat go together about the village; they imitate the actions of the
          two animals and perform dances, for which they receive a present in
          every house.<a id="noteref_964" name="noteref_964" href=

          Marburg in Steiermark the corn-spirit figures now as a wolf and now
          as a bear. The man who gave the last stroke at threshing is called
          the Wolf. All the other men flee from the barn, and wait till the
          Wolf comes forth; whereupon they pounce on him, wrap him in straw
          to resemble a wolf, and so lead him about the village. He keeps the
          name of Wolf till Christmas, when he is wrapt in a goat's skin and
          led from house to house as a Pease-bear at the end of a rope.<a id=

          this custom the dressing of the mummer in a goat's skin seems to
          mark him out as the representative of a goat; so that here the
          mythical fancy of the people apparently hesitates between a goat, a
          bear, and a wolf as the proper embodiment of the corn-spirit. In
          Scandinavia the conception of the spirit as a goat who appears at
          Christmas (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Julbuck</span></span>) appears to be common.
          Thus, for example, in Bergslagshärad (Sweden) it used to be
          customary at Christmas to lead about a man completely wrapt in
          corn-straw and wearing a goat's horns on his head: he personated
          the Yule-goat.<a id="noteref_966" name="noteref_966" href=

          some parts of Sweden a regular feature of the little Christmas
          drama is a pretence of slaughtering the Yule-goat, who, however,

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> hidden by a coverlet made of skins and
          wearing a pair of formidable horns, is led into the room by two
          men, who make believe to slaughter him, while they sing verses
          referring to the mantles of various colours, red, blue, white, and
          yellow, which they laid on him, one after the other. At the
          conclusion of the song, the Yule-goat, after feigning death, jumps
          up and skips about to the amusement of the spectators.<a id=

          dancing <span class="tei tei-q">“the angel dance”</span> for the
          sake of ensuring a good crop of flax, some long stalks of the Yule
          straw, either of wheat or rye, are made up into the likeness of a
          goat, which is thrown among the dancers with the cry, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Catch the Yule-goat!”</span> The custom in Dalarne is
          similar, except that there the straw-animal goes by the name of the

          these customs the identification of the Yule-goat or the Yule-ram
          with the corn-spirit seems unmistakable. As if to clinch the
          argument it is customary in Denmark and Sweden to bake cakes of
          fine meal at Christmas in the form of goats, rams, or boars. These
          are called Yule-goats, Yule-rams, or Yule-boars; they are often
          made out of the last sheaf of corn at harvest and kept till
          sowing-time, when they are partly mixed with the seed-corn and
          partly eaten by the people and the plough-oxen in the hope thereby
          of securing a good harvest.<a id="noteref_969" name="noteref_969"
          href="#note_969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">969</span></span></a> It
          would seem scarcely possible to represent the identification of the
          corn-spirit with an animal, whether goat, ram, or boar, more
          graphically; for the last corn cut at harvest is regularly supposed
          to house the corn-spirit, who is accordingly caught, kept through
          the winter in the shape of an animal, and then mixed with the seed
          in spring to quicken the grain before it is committed to the
          ground. Examples of the corn-spirit conceived as a wether and a
          boar have met us in a preceding part of this work.<a id=

          pretence of killing the Yule-goat and bringing him to life again
          was probably in origin a magical rite to ensure the rebirth of the
          corn-spirit in spring.</p>

          feared the custom had died out. In my boyhood the Straw-bear was a
          man completely swathed in straw, led by a string by another and
          made to dance in front of people's houses, in return for which
          money was expected. This always took place on the Tuesday following
          Plough-Monday. Yesterday the Straw-bear was a boy, and I saw no
          dancing. Otherwise there was no change.”</span><a id="noteref_971"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A comparison of
          this English custom with the similar Continental customs which have
          been described above, raises a presumption that the Straw-bear, who
          is thus led about from house to house, represents the corn-spirit
          bestowing his blessing on every homestead in the village. This
          interpretation is strongly confirmed by the date at which the
          ceremony takes place. For the date is the day after Plough Monday,
          and it can hardly be doubted that the old popular celebration of
          Plough Monday has a direct reference to agriculture. Plough Monday
          is the first Monday of January after Twelfth Day. On that day it
          used to be the custom in various parts of England for a band of
          sturdy swains to drag a gaily decorated plough from house to house
          and village to village, collecting contributions which were
          afterwards spent in rustic revelry at a tavern. The men who drew
          the plough were called Plough Bullocks; they wore their shirts over
          their coats, and bunches of ribbons flaunted from their hats and
          persons. Among them there was always one who personated a much
          bedizened old woman called Bessy; under his gown he formerly had a
          bullock's tail fastened to him behind, but this appendage was
          afterwards discarded. He skipped, danced and cut capers, and
          carried a money-box soliciting contributions from the onlookers.
          Some of the band, in addition to their ribbons, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“also wore small bunches of corn in their hats, from
          which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name=
          "Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the wheat was soon
          shaken out by the ungainly jumping which they called dancing.
          Occasionally, if the winter was severe, the procession was joined
          by threshers carrying their flails, reapers bearing their sickles,
          and carters with their long whips, which they were ever cracking to
          add to the noise, while even the smith and the miller were among
          the number, for the one sharpened the plough-shares and the other
          ground the corn; and Bessy rattled his box and danced so high that
          he shewed his worsted stockings and corduroy breeches; and very
          often, if there was a thaw, tucked up his gown skirts under his
          waistcoat, and shook the bonnet off his head, and disarranged the
          long ringlets that ought to have concealed his whiskers.”</span>
          Sometimes among the mummers there was a Fool, who wore the skin of
          a calf with the tail hanging down behind, and wielded a stick with
          an inflated bladder tied to it, which he applied with rude vigour
          to the heads and shoulders of the human team. Another mummer
          generally wore a fox's skin in the form of a hood with the tail
          dangling on his back. If any churl refused to contribute to the
          money-box, the plough-bullocks put their shoulders to the plough
          and ploughed up the ground in front of his door.<a id="noteref_972"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The clue to the
          meaning of these curious rites is probably furnished by the dances
          or rather jumps of the men who wore bunches of corn in their hats.
          When we remember how often on the Continent about the same time of
          year the peasants dance and jump for the express purpose
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name=
          "Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of making the crops
          grow tall, we may conjecture with some probability that the
          intention of the dancers on Plough Monday was similar; the original
          notion, we may suppose, was that the corn would grow that year just
          as high as the dancers leaped. If that was so, we need not wonder
          at the agility displayed on these occasions by the yokels in
          general and by Bessy in particular. What stronger incentive could
          they have to exert themselves than the belief that the higher they
          leaped into the air the higher would sprout the corn-stalks? In
          short, the whole ceremony was probably a magical rite intended to
          procure a good crop. The principle on which it rested was the
          familiar one of homoeopathic or imitative magic: by mimicking the
          act of ploughing and the growth of the corn the mummers hoped to
          ensure the success of the real ploughing, which was soon to take
          place.</p>

          represents indeed the corn-spirit. What could be more appropriate
          than for that beneficent being to manifest himself from house to
          house the very day after a magical ceremony had been performed to
          quicken the growth of the corn?</p>

          mock ploughing is probably practised for the same purpose in both
          cases, and what that purpose is may be safely inferred from the act
          of sowing and the offering of prayers for abundant crops which
          accompany and explain the Thracian ceremony. It deserves to be
          noted that ceremonies of the same sort and closely resembling those
          of Plough Monday are not confined to the Greek villages of Thrace
          but are observed also by the Bulgarians of that province at the
          same time, namely, on the Monday of the last week in Carnival. Thus

          "font-style: italic">Kuker</span></span> is a man clad in a
          goatskin. His face is blackened with soot and he wears on his head
          a high shaggy hat made of an entire skin. Bells jingle at his
          girdle, and in his hand he carries a club. The <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kukerica</span></span>, who sometimes goes by
          the name of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Baba</span></span>, that is, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Old Woman,”</span> is a man disguised in petticoats
          with his face blackened. Other figures in the procession are young
          men dressed as girls, and girls dressed as men and wearing masks.
          Bears are represented by dogs wrapt in bearskins. A king, a judge,
          and other officials are personated by other mummers; they hold a
          mock court and those whom they condemn receive a bastinado. Some of
          the maskers carry clubs; it is their duty to beat all who fall into
          their hands and to levy contributions from them. The play and
          gestures of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kuker</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kukerica</span></span> are wanton and
          lascivious: the songs and cries addressed to the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kuker</span></span> are also very cynical.
          Towards evening two of the company are yoked to a plough, and the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kuker</span></span> ploughs a few furrows,
          which he thereupon sows with corn. After sunset he puts off his
          disguise, is paid for his trouble, and carouses with his fellows.
          The people believe that the man who plays the part of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kuker</span></span> commits a deadly sin, and
          the priests make vain efforts to abolish the custom. At the village
          of Kuria, in the district of Losengrad, the custom is in general
          the same, but there are some significant variations. The money
          collected by the mummers is used to buy wine, which is distributed
          among all the villagers at a banquet in the evening. On this
          occasion a cake in which an old coin has been baked is produced by
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kuker</span></span>, broken into bits, and so
          divided among all present. If the bit with the coin in it falls to
          a farmer, then the crops will be good that year; but if it falls to
          a herdsman, then the cattle will thrive. Finally, the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kuker</span></span> ploughs a small patch of
          ground, <span class="tei tei-q">“bending his body to right and left
          in order to indicate symbolically the ears of corn bending under
          the weight of the grain.”</span> The others lay hold of the man
          with whom the coin was found, bind him by the feet, and drag him
          over the land that has just been ploughed.<a id="noteref_974" name=
          "noteref_974" href="#note_974"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">974</span></span></a> In
          these observances the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg
          333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          intention of promoting the fertility of the ground is unmistakable;
          the ploughman's imitation of the cornstalks bending under their own
          weight is a simple case of homoeopathic or imitative magic, while
          the omens drawn from the occupation of the person who obtains the
          piece of cake with the coin in it indicate that the ceremony is
          designed to quicken the herds as well as the crops. We can hardly
          doubt that the same serious motive underlies the seemingly wanton
          gestures of the principal actors and explains the loose character
          of the songs and words which accompany the ceremony. Nor is it hard
          to divine the reason for dragging over the fresh furrows the man
          who is lucky enough to get the coin in the cake. He is probably
          looked on as an embodiment of the corn-spirit, and in that
          character is compelled to fertilise the ground by bodily contact
          with the newly-ploughed earth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similar customs
          are observed at the Carnival not only by Bulgarian peasants in
          Thrace but also here and there in Bulgaria itself. In that country
          the leading personage of the masquerade is the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Baba</span></span>, that is, the Old Woman or
          Mother. The part is played by a man in woman's clothes; she, or
          rather he, wears no mask, but in many villages she carries a
          spindle with which she spins. The <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kuker</span></span> and the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kukerica</span></span> also figure in the
          performance, but they are subordinate to the Old Woman or Mother.
          Their costume varies in different villages. Usually they are clad
          in skins with a girdle of lime-tree bark and five or six bells
          fastened to it; on their back they wear a hump made up of rags. But
          the principal feature in their attire consists of their masks,
          which represent the heads of animals and men in fantastic
          combinations, such as the horned head of a man or a bird, the head
          of a ram, a bull, and so on. Much labour is spent on the
          manufacture of these masks. Early in the morning of Cheese Monday
          (the Monday of the last week in Carnival) the mummers go about the
          village levying contributions. Towards noon they form a procession
          and go from house to house. In every house they dance a round
          dance, while the Old Woman spins. It is believed that if any
          house-holder contrives to carry off the Old Woman and secrete her,
          a blessing and prosperity will enter into his dwelling;
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name=
          "Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> but the maskers
          defend the Old Woman stoutly against all such attempts of
          individuals to appropriate her beneficent presence. After the dance
          the mummers receive gifts of money, eggs, meal, and so on. Towards
          evening a round dance is danced in the village square, and there
          the Old Woman yokes the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kuker</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kukerica</span></span> to a plough, ploughs
          with it a small piece of ground, and sows the ground with corn.
          Next day the performers reassemble, sell the presents they had
          collected, and with the produce hold a feast in the house of the
          Old Woman. It is supposed that if strange maskers make their way
          into a village, fertility will be drawn away to the village from
          which they have come; hence the villagers resist an inroad of
          strange maskers at any price. In general the people believe that
          the masquerade is performed for the purpose of increasing the luck
          and fertility of the village.<a id="noteref_975" name="noteref_975"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          Bulgarian rites, accordingly, we are not left to form conjectures
          as to the intention with which they are practised; that intention
          is plainly avowed, and it is no other than the one which we have
          inferred for the similar rites observed in Thrace at the same
          season and in England on Plough Monday. In all these cases it is
          reasonable to suppose that the real aim of the ceremonial ploughing
          and sowing of the ground is thereby, on the principles of
          homoeopathic or imitative magic, to ensure the growth of the corn
          on all the fields of the community. Perhaps we may go a step
          further and suggest that in the Bulgarian Old Woman or Mother, who
          guides the plough and sows the seed, and whose presence is believed
          to bring a blessing to any household that can contrive to
          appropriate her, we have the rustic prototype of Demeter, the
          Corn-Mother, who in the likeness of an Old Woman brought a blessing
          to the house of Celeus, king of Eleusis, and restored their lost
          fertility to the fallow Eleusinian fields. And in the pair of
          mummers, man and woman, who draw the plough, may we not discern the
          rude originals of Pluto and Persephone? If that is so, the gods of
          Greece are not wholly dead; they still hide their diminished heads
          in the cottages of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg

          peasantry, to come forth on sunshine holidays and parade, with a
          simple but expressive pageantry, among a gazing crowd of rustics,
          at the very moment of the year when their help is most wanted by
          the husbandman.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Be that as it
          may, these rites still practised by the peasantry at opposite ends
          of Europe, no doubt date from an extremely early age in the history
          of agriculture. They are probably far older than Christianity,
          older even than those highly developed forms of Greek religion with
          which ancient writers and artists have made us familiar, but which
          have been for so many centuries a thing of the past. Thus it
          happens that, while the fine flower of the religious consciousness
          in myth, ritual, and art is fleeting and evanescent, its simpler
          forms are comparatively stable and permanent, being rooted deep in
          those principles of common minds which bid fair to outlive all the
          splendid but transient creations of genius. It may be that the
          elaborate theologies, the solemn rites, the stately temples, which
          now attract the reverence or the wonder of mankind, are destined
          themselves to pass away like <span class="tei tei-q">“all Olympus'

          the simple faiths of their nameless and dateless forefathers, will
          still believe in witches and fairies, in ghosts and hobgoblins,
          will still mumble the old spells and make the old magic passes,
          when the muezzin shall have ceased to call the faithful to prayer
          from the minarets of St. Sophia, and when the worshippers shall

        an agricultural tribe of Assam, the close of the rice-harvest is
        celebrated by a festival in which the effigy of a horse figures
        prominently. The intention of the ceremony is not stated, but
        possibly it may be to ensure a good rice crop in the following year.
        If so, the artificial horse of the Garos would be analogous to the

        most festive observance of the year, and combines religious sacrifice
        with much conviviality. It is celebrated by all sections of the tribe
        except the Duals and some Plains Garos. The cost of the entertainment
        falls principally on the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nokma</span></span> [headman] of the village,
        who provides a pig to be eaten by his guests, and plenty of liquor.
        Among the Akawés and Chisaks of the north and north-eastern hills a
        curious feature of the ceremony is the manufacture of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">guré</span></span>
        or <span class="tei tei-q">‘horses’</span> out of pieces of
        plantain-stem for the body, and of bamboo for the head and legs. The
        image of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘horse’</span> is laid on the
        floor of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        guests dance and sing around it the whole night long, with the usual
        intervals for refreshments. Early the next morning, the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘horse’</span> is taken to the nearest river and launched
        on the water to find its way down stream on the current. For those
        who possess the necessary paraphernalia, the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">guré</span></span>
        takes the shape of a horse's head of large size, made of straw, and
        covered with cloth. I once saw one in the village of Rongrong, which,
        when in use, was ornamented with discs of brass on both sides of the
        face. Its eyes and ears were made of the same metal, and between the
        ears were fixed a pair of wild goat's horns. To the head were
        attached a number <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg
        338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        bronze bells similar to those hawked about by Bhutia pedlars. The
        owner, a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">laskar</span></span>, was unable to tell me
        whence they came, but said that they were inherited from his wife's

        is used is the following. The head is mounted on a stick, which a man
        holds before him in such a way that the head comes up to the level of
        his chest. Two straps pass over his shoulders to relieve his hands of
        the weight. The body of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘horse’</span> is
        then built round his own body with cane and cloth. For a tail, yak's
        tails are fastened in with his own hair, which, for the occasion, is
        allowed to hang down instead of being tied up. The performer thus
        apparelled, commences to dance a shuffling step to the usual music.
        In front of him dances the priest, who goes through the pantomime of
        beckoning the animal to come to him. The remaining guests of the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">queue</span></em>
        behind the 'horse,' and dance after it. When the first man gets
        tired, another takes his place, and the dancing goes on right through
        the night. A pleasant part of the performance is the pelting of the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        egg-shell was still sticking to the horn of the <span class=

        is taken to a stream and the body thrown into the water, the head

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Can it be that the
        horse whose effigy is thus made at rice-harvest and thrown into the
        water, while the head is kept for another year, represents the spirit
        of the rice? If that were so, the pelting of the head with eggs would
        be a charm to ensure fertility and the throwing of it into water
        would be a rain-charm. And on the same theory the horse's head would
        be comparable to the horse-headed Demeter of Phigalia<a id=
        "noteref_977" name="noteref_977" href="#note_977"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">977</span></span></a> as well
        as to the head of the October horse at Rome, which was nailed to a
        wall, probably to be kept there till next October. If we knew more
        about the rites of the horse-headed Demeter at Phigalia, we might
        find that amongst them was a dance of a man or woman who wore the
        mask of a horse's head and personated the goddess herself, just as,
        if I am right, the man who dances disguised as a horse at the harvest
        festival of the Garos, represents the spirit of the rice dancing
        among the garnered sheaves. The conjecture is to some extent
        supported by the remains <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg
        339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        the magnificent marble drapery, which once adorned the colossal
        statue of Demeter or Persephone in the sanctuary of the two goddesses
        at Lycosura, in Arcadia; for on that drapery are carved rows of
        semi-human, semi-bestial figures dancing and playing musical
        instruments; the bodies of the figures are those of women, but their
        heads, paws, and feet are those of animals. Among the heads set on
        the figures are those of a horse, a pig, a cat or a hare, and
        apparently an ass.<a id="noteref_978" name="noteref_978" href=
        "#note_978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">978</span></span></a> It is
        reasonable to suppose that these dancing figures represent a ritual
        dance which was actually performed in the rites of Demeter and
        Persephone by masked men or women, who personated the goddesses in
        their character of beasts.</p>

          iii. pp. 113-211. In the text I have allowed my former exposition
          of Mannhardt's theory as to ancient semi-goat-shaped spirits of
          vegetation to stand as before, but I have done so with hesitation,
          because the evidence adduced in its favour appears to me
          insufficient to permit us to speak with any confidence on the
          subject. Pan may have been, as W. H. Roscher and L. R. Farnell
          think, nothing more than a herdsman's god, the semi-human,
          semi-bestial representative of goats in particular. See W. H.
          Roscher's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          68), with the close of the threshing in Attica. No writer mentions
          the trial of both the axe and the knife. Pausanias speaks of the
          trial of the axe, Porphyry and Aelian of the trial of the knife.
          But from Porphyry's description it is clear that the slaughter was
          carried out by two men, one wielding an axe and the other a knife,
          and that the former laid the blame on the latter. Perhaps the knife
          alone was condemned. That the King (as to whom see <span class=

          note 4. It is interesting to observe that at Magnesia the sowing
          took place in Cronion, the month of Cronus, a god whom the ancients
          regularly identified with Saturn, the Italian god of sowing. In
          Samos, Perinthus, and Patmos, however, the month Cronion seems to
          have been equivalent to the Attic Scirophorion, a month
          corresponding to June or July, which could never have been a season
          of sowing in the hot rainless summers of Greece. See E. Bischoff,

          ceremony as he witnessed it at Kashgar, the writer adds:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Probably the ox was at first a living
          animal which they sacrificed and distributed the flesh to the
          bystanders. At the present day the official who acts as pontiff has
          a number of small pasteboard oxen made, which he sends to the
          notables in order that they may participate intimately in the
          sacrifice, which is more than symbolical. The reason for carrying
          the ox a long distance is that as much as possible of the territory
          may be sanctified by the passage of the sacred animal, and that as
          many people as possible may share in the sacrifice, at least with
          their eyes and good wishes. The procession, which begins very early
          in the morning, moves eastward, that is, toward the quarter where,
          the winter being now over, the first sun of spring may be expected
          to appear, whose divinity the ceremony is intended to render
          propitious. It is needless to insist on the analogy between this
          Chinese festival and our Carnival, at which, about the same season,
          a fat ox is led about. Both festivals have their origin in the same
          conceptions of ancient natural religion.”</span></dd>

          the son of Heaven on the first day prays to God for a good year;
          and afterwards, the day of the first conjunction of the sun and
          moon having been chosen, with the handle and share of the plough in

          turns up three furrows, each of the ducal ministers five, and the
          other ministers and feudal princes nine. When they return, he takes

          weakened, if not destroyed, by a fact which I had overlooked when I
          wrote this book originally. A goat was sacrificed to Brauronian
          Artemis at her festival called the Brauronia (Hesychius,

          Mathaeus Praetorius, the author to whom we owe the account in the
          text, compiled a detailed description of old Lithuanian manners and
          customs in the latter part of the seventeenth century at the
          village of Niebudzen, of which he was Protestant pastor. The work,
          which seems to have occupied him for many years and to have been
          finished about 1698, exists in manuscript but has never been
          published in full. Only excerpts from it have been printed by Dr.
          W. Pierson. Praetorius was born at Memel about 1635 and died in
          1707. In the later years of his life he incurred a good deal of
          odium by joining the Catholic Church.</dd>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“slaves of the Earth-gods”</span> are
          children whom women have obtained through prayers offered to
          Agbasia, the greatest of the Earth-gods. When such a child is born,
          it is regarded as the slave of Agbasia; and the mother dedicates it
          to the service of the god, as in similar circumstances Hannah
          dedicated Samuel to the Lord (1 Samuel i.). If the child is a girl,
          she is married to the priest's son; if it is a boy, he serves the
          priest until his mother has given birth to a girl whom she
          exchanges for the boy. See J. Spieth, <span class=

          that after executing a grotesque dance in the presence of the
          assembled multitude the king gives formal permission to eat of the
          new fruits by dashing a gourd or calabash to the ground. This
          ceremony of breaking the calabash is mentioned also by J. Shooter
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kafirs
          of Natal</span></span>, p. 27), L. Grout (<span class=

          Dudley Kidd (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">The Essential Kafir</span></span>, p. 271).
          According to this last writer the calabash is filled with boiled
          specimens of the new fruits, and the king sprinkles the people with
          the cooked food, frequently spitting it out on them. Mr. Grout
          tells us (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">l.c.</span></span>) that at the ceremony a
          bull is killed and its gall drunk by the king and the people. In
          killing it the warriors must use nothing but their naked hands. The
          flesh of the bull is given to the boys to eat what they like and
          burn the rest; the men may not taste it. See L. Grout, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
          cit.</span></span> p. 161. According to Shooter, two bulls are
          killed; the first is black, the second of another colour. The boys
          who eat the beef of the black bull may not drink till the next
          morning, else the king would be defeated in war or visited with
          some personal misfortune. See Shooter, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
          cit.</span></span> pp. 26 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span> According to another account
          the sacrifice of the bull, performed by the warriors of a
          particular regiment with their bare hands, takes place several
          weeks before the festival of first-fruits, and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the strength of the bull is supposed to enter into the

          substitute for it (J. Roscoe, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          However, the motive which underlies the taboo appears to be a fear

          According to Reichard the warriors may partake of honey both with
          meat and with milk. Thomson does not mention honey and speaks of a
          purgative only. The periods during which meat and milk are
          alternately consumed vary, according to Reichard, from twelve to
          fifteen days. We may conjecture, therefore, that two of them,
          making up a complete cycle, correspond to a lunar month, with
          reference to which the diet is perhaps determined.</dd>

          cases the motive, as with the Masai, is probably a fear of injuring
          the cattle, and especially of causing the cows to loose their milk.
          This is confirmed by other taboos of the same sort observed by the
          Suk. Thus they think that to eat the flesh of a certain forest pig
          would cause the cattle of the eater to run dry, and that if a rich
          man ate fish his cows would give no milk. See M. W. H. Beech,

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The ancients were at least familiar
          with the practice of sacrificing images made of dough or other
          materials as substitutes for the animals themselves. It was a
          recognised principle that when an animal could not be easily
          obtained for sacrifice, it was lawful to offer an image of it made
          of bread or wax. See Servius on Virgil, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aen.</span></span>
          ii. 116; compare Pausanias, x. 18. 5. Poor people who could not
          afford to sacrifice real animals offered dough images of them
          (Suidas, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">s.v.</span></span> βοῦς ἕβδομος; compare
          Hesychius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">s.vv.</span></span> βοῦς, ἕβδομος βοῦς). Hence
          bakers made a regular business of baking cakes in the likeness of
          all the animals which were sacrificed to the gods (Proculus, quoted
          and emended by Chr. A. Lobeck, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aglaophamus</span></span>,
          p. 1079). When Cyzicus was besieged by Mithridates and the people
          could not procure a black cow to sacrifice at the rites of
          Persephone, they made a cow of dough and placed it at the altar
          (Plutarch, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Lucullus</span></span>, 10). In a Boeotian
          sacrifice to Hercules, in place of the ram which was the proper
          victim, an apple was regularly substituted, four chips being stuck
          in it to represent legs and two to represent horns (Julius Pollux,
          i. 30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>). The Athenians are said to
          have once offered to Hercules a similar substitute for an ox
          (Zenobius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cent.</span></span> v. 22). And the Locrians,
          being at a loss for an ox to sacrifice, made one out of figs and
          sticks, and offered it instead of the animal (Zenobius,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cent.</span></span> v. 5). At the Athenian
          festival of the Diasia cakes shaped like animals were sacrificed
          (Schol. on Thucydides, i. 126, p. 36, ed. Didot). We have seen
          above (p. <a href="#Pg025" class="tei tei-ref">25</a>) that the
          poorer Egyptians offered cakes of dough instead of pigs. The
          Cheremiss of Russia sometimes offer cakes in the shape of horses
          instead of the real animals. See P. v. Stenin, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ein neuer Beitrag zur Ethnographie der
          Tscheremissen,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span> Similarly a North-American
          Indian dreamed that a sacrifice of twenty elans was necessary for
          the recovery of a sick girl; but the elans could not be procured,
          and the girl's parents were allowed to sacrifice twenty loaves
          instead. See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The practice is curiously unlike the
          custom of ancient Italy, in most parts of which women were
          forbidden by law to walk on the highroads twirling a spindle,
          because this was supposed to injure the crops (Pliny, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nat.
          Hist.</span></span> xxviii. 28). The purpose of the Indian custom
          may be to ward off evil influences from the field, as Mr. W. Crooke
          suggests (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          believe that the ghost of an animal as well as of a man will haunt
          its slayer and drive him mad unless he performs a ceremony called
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          killed a tiger must dress himself up as a woman, put flints into
          the tiger's mouth, and eat eggs himself, after which he makes a
          speech to the tiger and gives it three cuts over the head with a
          sword. During this performance the principal performer must keep
          perfectly grave. Should he accidentally laugh, he says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The porcupine laughed,”</span> referring
          to a real porcupine which he carries in his arms for the purpose.

            discipline of the Spanish monks is noticed by other travellers.
            We are told that the Indians laboured during the day in the
            fields to support their Spanish masters, were driven to church
            twice or thrice a day to hear service in a language which they
            did not understand, and at night were shut up in crowded and
            comfortless barracks, without windows and without beds. When the
            monks desired to make new proselytes, or rather to capture new
            slaves, they called in the aid of the soldiery, who attacked the
            Indian villages by night, lassoed the fugitives, and dragged them
            back at their horses' tails to slavery in the missions. See O.

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the animal slain probably is, or once was,

          then. In regard to the Californian custom in particular, there
          appears to be no good evidence that within the area now occupied by
          the United States totemism was practised by any tribes to the west
          of the Rocky Mountains. See H. Hale, <span class=

          evidence this is no proof of totemism.</dd>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“We kill you, O bear! Come back soon into
          an Aino.”</span> According to Dr. Siebold, a very respectable

          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have often insisted both in my lectures

          <span lang="ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=

          offerings to the deities, and set them up as signs showing
          reverence towards them. This, I must now remark, is true but in
          part, for while some of the ordinary or less important kinds are
          not worshipped, there are several others which are. Those
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          regarded as messengers sent to the higher deities.”</span> On the

          these whittled sticks to the use of holy candles among Roman
          Catholics. In Borneo the search for camphor is attended by many
          superstitions; among other things, when the searchers have found a
          tree which promises to yield much camphor <span class=

          The Hebrews sacrificed and burned incense to their nets (Habakkuk
          i. 16). In some of the mountain villages of Annam the people, who
          are great hunters, sacrifice fowls, rice, incense, and gilt paper
          to their nets at the festival of the New Year. See Le R. P.

          net has caught little or nothing, the Ewe negroes think that it
          must be hungry; so they call in the help of a priest, who commonly
          feeds the hungry net by sprinkling maize-flour and fish, moistened
          with palm oil, on its meshes. See G. Härtter, <span class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">At the annual sacrifice of the White
          Dog, the Iroquois were careful to strangle the animal without
          shedding its blood or breaking its bones; the dog was afterwards
          burned (L. H. Morgan, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Rochester, 1851, p. 210). It is a rule with some of the Australian
          blacks that in killing the native bear they may not break his
          bones. They say that the native bear once stole all the water of
          the river, and that if they were to break his bones or take off his
          skin before roasting him, he would do so again (R. Brough Smyth,

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          aborigines believe that if the bones or skulls of dugong were not
          put away in a heap or otherwise preserved, no more dugong would be
          caught (W. E. Roth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">North Queensland Ethnography</span></span>,
          Bulletin No. 5, Brisbane, 1903, p. 27). When the Tartars whom
          Carpini visited killed animals for eating, they might not break
          their bones but burned them with fire (Carpini, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Historia
          Mongalorum</span></span> (Paris, 1838), cap. iii. § i. 2, p. 620).
          North American Indians might not break the bones of the animals
          which they ate at feasts (Charlevoix, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Histoire de la
          Nouvelle France</span></span>, vi. 72). In the war feast held by
          Indian warriors after leaving home, a whole animal was cooked and
          had to be all eaten. No bone of it might be broken. After being
          stripped of the flesh the bones were hung on a tree (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Narrative of the
          Captivity and Adventures of John Tanner</span></span>, London,
          1830, p. 287). On St. Olaf's Day (29th July) the Karels of Finland
          kill a lamb, without using a knife, and roast it whole. None of its
          bones may be broken. The lamb has not been shorn since spring. Some
          of the flesh is placed in a corner of the room for the
          house-spirits, some is deposited on the field and beside the
          birch-trees which are destined to be used as May-trees next year
          (W. Mannhardt, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          160 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>, note). Some of the
          Esquimaux in skinning a deer are careful not to break a single
          bone, and they will not break the bones of deer while walrus are
          being hunted (Fr. Boas, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Central
          Eskimo,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>).
          The Innuit (Esquimaux) of Point Barrow, Alaska, carefully preserve
          unbroken the bones of the seals which they have caught and return
          them to the sea, either leaving them in an ice-crack far out from
          the land or dropping them through a hole in the ice. By doing so
          they think they secure good fortune in the pursuit of seals
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Report
          of the International Expedition to Point Barrow,
          Alaska</span></span> (Washington, 1885), p. 40). In this last
          custom the idea probably is that the bones will be reclothed with
          flesh and the seals come to life again. The Mosquito Indians of
          Central America carefully preserved the bones of deer and the
          shells of eggs, lest the deer or chickens should die or disappear
          (H. H. Bancroft, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Native Races of the Pacific
          States</span></span>, i. 741). In Syria at the present time people
          offer a sacrifice for a boy when he is seven days old, and they
          will not break a bone of the victim, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“because they fear that if a bone of the sacrifice
          should be broken, the child's bones would be broken, too”</span>
          (S. I. Curtiss, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Primitive Semitic Religion
          To-day</span></span>, Chicago, etc., 1902, p. 178). This last may
          be a later misinterpretation of the old custom. For West African
          cases of refusal to break the bones of sacrificial victims, see J.
          Spieth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          South Australia, when an animal was being cut up, the bystanders
          used to leap and yell as often as a bone was broken, thinking that
          if they did not do so their own bones would rot within them (A. W.

          them does not necessarily contradict the view suggested in the
          text. It may be a way of transmitting the bones to the spirit-land.
          The aborigines of Australia burn the bones of the animals which
          they eat, but for a different reason; they think that if an enemy
          got hold of the bones and burned them with charms, it would cause
          the death of the person who had eaten the animal (<span class=

          forces; he regards a living being simply as a very delicately
          constructed machine in which the natural forces are in a state of

          add that I do not pretend to argue either for or against the theory

          are terrible. From time to time whole armies of these destructive
          rodents appear and march across the country in dense columns and
          serried ranks, devouring everything as they go, and leaving famine,
          with all its horrors, in their train. See Lieut.-Col. Tournier,

          from which the present universe developed, was matter composed of
          large highly complex atoms, which have formed the simpler elements
          by radio-active or rayless disintegration? Or did the primaeval
          substance consist of isolated electrons, which have slowly come
          together to form the elements, and yet have left here and there an
          anomaly such as that illustrated by the unstable family of uranium

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">In our own time the theory of
          transmigration is favoured by Dr. McTaggart, who argues that human
          beings may have lived before birth and may live many, perhaps an
          infinite number of, lives after death. Like Plato he further
          suggests that the nature of the body into which a person
          transmigrates at death may be appropriate to and determined by his
          or her character in the preceding life. See J. McT. Ellis
          McTaggart, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Some Dogmas of Religion</span></span> (London,
          1906), pp. 112-139. However, Dr. McTaggart seems only to
          contemplate the transmigration of human souls into human bodies; he
          does not discuss the possibility of their transmigration into
          animals.</dd>

          by the American Indians towards the fish and game. But the account
          is not precise enough to allow us to speak with confidence. It is
          sometimes reported that the Australians attempt to appease the
          kangaroos which they have killed, assuring the animals of their
          affection and begging them not to come back after death to torment

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Morning
          Post</span></span> of Wednesday, 27th December 1911, we read that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the observance of the ancient and curious
          custom known as <span class="tei tei-q">‘the hunt of the
          wren’</span> was general throughout the Isle of Man yesterday.
          Parties of boys bearing poles decked with ivy and streamers went
          from house to house singing to an indescribable tune a quaint
          ballad detailing the pursuit and death of the wren, subsequently
          demanding recompense, which is rarely refused. Formerly boys
          actually engaged in the chase, stoning the bird to death with the
          object of distributing the feathers <span class="tei tei-q">‘for
          luck.’</span> ”</span> From this account we may gather that in the
          Isle of Man the hunting of the wren is now merely nominal and that
          the pretence of it is kept up only as an excuse for collecting
          gratuities. It is thus that the solemnity of ritual dwindles into
          the pastime of children. I have to thank Mrs. J. H. Deane, of 41
          Iverna Court, Kensington, for kindly sending me the extract from

          "tei tei-q">“hunting of the wren”</span> may be compared with a
          Swedish custom. On the 1st of May children rob the magpies' nests
          of both eggs and young. These they carry in a basket from house to
          house in the village and shew to the housewives, while one of the
          children sings some doggerel lines containing a threat that, if a
          present is not given, the hens, chickens, and eggs will fall a prey
          to the magpie. They receive bacon, eggs, milk, etc., upon which
          they afterwards feast. See L. Lloyd, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peasant Life in
          Sweden</span></span> (London, 1870), pp. 237 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span> The
          resemblance of such customs to the <span class="tei tei-q">“swallow
          song”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“crow song”</span> of the
          ancient Greeks (on which see Athenaeus, viii. 59 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>,
          pp. 359, 360) is obvious and has been remarked before now. Probably
          the Greek swallow-singers and crow-singers carried about dead
          swallows and crows or effigies of them. The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“crow song”</span> is referred to in a Greek
          inscription found in the south of Russia ἕξ δεκάδας λυκάβας
          κεκορώνικα. See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Archaeological Commission, St. Petersburg, 1877, pp. 276
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Macedonia it is still customary for children on 1st March to go
          about the streets singing spring songs and carrying a wooden
          swallow, which is kept turning on a cylinder. See J. Grimm,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deutsche
          Mythologie</span></span>,<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          making the image of the swallow revolve on a pivot, which is
          practised in Macedonia as well as Greece, may be compared with the
          pirouetting of the girl in the Servian rain-making ceremony. The

          are Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Northamptonshire,
          Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire,
          Cheshire, and Yorkshire. Thus the custom would seem to have been
          characteristic of a group of counties in the centre of England. In
          January 1887, I witnessed the ceremony in the streets of Cambridge.
          Wooden ploughs of a primitive sort were dragged about by bands of
          young men who were profusely decked with scarves and ribbons. They
          ran at a good pace, and beside them ran a companion with a
          money-box collecting donations. Amongst them I did not observe any
          woman or man in female attire. Compare <span class=

              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=
